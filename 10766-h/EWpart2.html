<br>
<a name="p963"></a><b><i>963. &nbsp;Dew</i></b><br>
<br>
  If the dew lies plentifully on the grass after a fair day, it is a
  sign of another fair day. If not, and there is no wind, rain must
  follow. A red evening portends fine weather; but if the redness spread
  too far upwards from the horizon in the evening, and especially in the
  morning, it foretells wind or rain, or both.

<a name="p964"></a><b><i>964. &nbsp;Colour of Sky</i></b><br>
<br>

  When the sky, in rainy weather, is tinged with sea green, the rain
  will increase; if with deep blue, it will be showery.

<a name="p965"></a><b><i>965. &nbsp;Clouds</i></b><br>
<br>
  Previous to much rain falling, the clouds grow bigger, and increase
  very fast, especially before thunder. When the clouds are formed like
  fleeces, but dense in the middle and bright towards the edges, with
  the sky bright, they are signs of a frost, with hail, snow, or rain.
  If clouds form high in air, in thin white trains like locks of wool,
  they portend wind, and probably rain. When a general cloudiness covers
  the sky, and small black fragments of clouds fly underneath, they are
  a sure sign of rain, and probably will be lasting. Two currents of
  clouds always portend rain, and, in summer, thunder.
<br>

<a name="p966"></a><b><i>966. &nbsp;Heavenly Bodies</i></b><br>
<br>
  A haziness in the air, which dims the sun's light, and makes the orb
  appear whitish, or ill-defined&mdash;or at night, if the moon and stars
  grow dim, and a ring encircles the former, rain will follow. If the
  sun's rays appear like Moses' horns&mdash;if white at setting, or shorn of
  his rays, or if he goes down into a bank of clouds in the horizon, bad
  weather is to be expected. If the moon looks pale and dim, we expect
  rain; if red, wind; and if of her natural colour, with a clear sky,
  fair weather. If the moon is rainy throughout, it will clear at the
  change, and, perhaps, the rain return a few days after. If fair
  throughout, and rain at the change, the fair weather will probably
  return on the fourth or fifth day.

<a name="p967"></a><b><i>967. &nbsp;Weather Precautions</i></b><br>
<br>
  If the weather appears doubtful, always take the precaution of having
  an umbrella when you go out, as you thereby avoid the chance of
  getting wet&mdash;or encroaching under a friend's umbrella.&mdash;or being under
  the necessity of borrowing one, which involves the trouble of
  returning it, and possibly puts the lender to inconvenience.

<a name="p968"></a><b><i>968. &nbsp;Leech Barometer</i></b><br>
<br>
  Take an eight ounce phial and three-parts fill it with water, and
  place in it a healthy leech, changing the water in summer once a week,
  and in winter once in a fortnight, and it will most accurately
  prognosticate the weather.  If the weather is to be fine, the leech
  lies motionless at the bottom of the glass, and coiled together in a
  spiral form; if rain may be expected, it will creep up to the top of
  its lodgings, and remain there till the weather is settled; if we are
  to have wind, it will move through its habitation with amazing
  swiftness, and seldom goes to rest till it begins to blow hard; if a
  remarkable storm of thunder and rain is to succeed, it will lodge for
  some days before almost continually out of the water, and discover
  great uneasiness in violent throes and convulsive-like motions; in
  frost as in clear summer-like weather it lies constantly at the
  bottom; and in snow as in rainy weather it pitches its dwelling in the
  very mouth of the phial. The top should be covered over with a piece
  of muslin.

<a name="p969"></a><b><i>969. &nbsp;The Chemical Barometer</i></b><br>
<br>
  Take a long narrow bottle, such as an old-fashioned Eau-de-Cologne
  bottle, and put into it two and a half drachms of camphor, and eleven
  drachms of spirit of wine; when the camphor is dissolved, which it
  will readily do by slight agitation, add the following mixture:&mdash;Take
  water, nine drachms; nitrate of potash (saltpetre), thirty-eight
  grains; and muriate of ammonia (sal ammoniæ), thirty-eight grains.
  Dissolve these salts in the water prior to mixing with the camphorated
  spirit; then shake the whole well together. Cork the bottle well, and
  wax the top, but afterwards make a very small aperture in the cork
  with a red-hot needle. The bottle may then be hung up, or placed in
  any stationary position. By observing the different appearances which
  the materials assume, as the weather changes, it becomes an excellent
  prognosticator of a coming storm or of fine weather.

<a name="p973"></a><b><i>973. &nbsp;Hints on the Barometer</i></b><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<a name="p974"></a><b><i>974. &nbsp;Why does a Barometer indicate the Pressure of the Atmosphere?</i></b><br>
<br>
  Because it consists of a tube containing quicksilver, closed at one
  end and open at the other, so that the pressure of air upon the open
  end balances the weight of the column of mercury (quicksilver); and
  when the pressure of the air upon the open surface of the mercury
  increases or decreases, the mercury rises or falls in response thereto.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p975"></a><b><i>975. &nbsp;Why is a Barometer called also a "Weather Glass"?</i></b><br>
<br>
  Because changes in the weather are generally preceded by alterations
  in the atmospheric pressure. But we cannot perceive those changes as
  they gradually occur; the alteration in the height of the column of
  mercury, therefore, enables us to know that atmospheric changes are
  taking place, and by observation we are enabled to determine certain
  rules by which the state of the weather may be foretold with
  considerable probability.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p976"></a><b><i>976. &nbsp;Why docs the Hand of the Weather Dial change its Position when the Column of Mercury rises or falls?</i></b><br>
<br>
  Because a weight which floats upon the open surface of the mercury is
  attached to a string, having a nearly equal weight at the other
  extremity; the string is laid over a revolving pivot, to which the
  hand is fixed, and the friction of the string turns the hand as the
  mercury rises or falls.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p977"></a><b><i>977. &nbsp;Why does Tapping the Face of the Barometer sometimes cause the Hand to Move?</i></b><br>
<br>
  Because the weight on the surface of the mercury frequently leans
  against the side of the tube, and does not move freely. And, also, the
  mercury clings to the sides of the tube by capillary attraction;
  therefore, tapping on the face of the barometer sets the weight free,
  and overcomes the attraction which impedes the rise or fall of the
  mercury.

<a name="p978"></a><b><i>978. &nbsp;Why does the Fall of the Barometer denote the Approach of Rain? </i></b><br>
<br>
  Because it shows that as the air cannot support the full weight of the
  column of mercury, the atmosphere must be thin with watery vapours.
<br>

<a name="p979"></a><b><i>979. &nbsp;Why does the Rise of the Barometer denote the Approach of Fine Weather?</i></b><br>
<br>
  Because the external air, becoming dense, and free from highly elastic
  vapours, presses with increased force upon the mercury upon which the
  weight floats; that weight, therefore, sinks in the short tube as the
  mercury rises in the long one, and in sinking, turns the hand to
  Change, Fair, &amp;c.

  and use when hard and sufficiently dry. A fire cannot be lighted with

  The use of the poker should be confined to two particular points&mdash;the

  When using a pair of bellows to a fire only partially ignited, or

<br>
  To prove this it is only necessary to remove the superfluous coal from
  the top of the grate, when the smoking instantly ceases; as to the
  waste, that evidently proceeds from the injudicious use of the poker,
  which not only throws a great portion of the small coals among the
  cinders, but often extinguishes the fire it was intended to foster.

<a name="p997"></a><b><i>997. &nbsp;The "Parson's" or Front Fire Grate</i></b><br>
<br>
The construction of most of the grates of the present day tends very
  much to a great consumption of fuel without a proportionate increase
  in the heat of the room. The "Parson's" grate was suggested by the
  late Mr. Mechi, of Tiptree Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, in order to obtain
  increased heat from less fuel. Speaking of this grate, Mr. Mechi
  says:
  
    <blockquote>"The tested gain by the use of this grate is an increase of 15
    degrees of temperature, with a saving of one-third in fuel. I
    believe that there are several millions of grates on the wrong
    principle, hurrying the heat up the chimney instead of into the
    room, and thus causing an in-draught of cold air. This is especially
    the case with strong drawing registers. No part of a grate should be
    of iron, except the thin front bars; for iron is a conductor away of
    heat, but fire-bricks are not so." </blockquote>
    
  The principle of the grate is thus explained by a writer in <i>The
  Field</i>, who says: 

   <blockquote> "If any of your readers are troubled with smoky fires and cold
    rooms, allow me to recommend them to follow Mr. Mechi's plan, as I
    have done. Remove the front and bottom bars from any ordinary grate;
    then lay on the hearth, under where the bars were, a large fire
    tile, three inches thick, cut to fit properly, and projecting about
    an inch further out than the old upright bars. Then get made by the
    blacksmith a straight hurdle, twelve inches deep, having ten bars,
    to fit into the slots which held the old bars, and allow it to take
    its bearing upon the projecting fire-brick. The bars should be
    round, of five-eighth inch rod, excepting the top and bottom, which
    are better flat, about 1-1/4 in. broad. My dining-room grate was
    thus altered at a total cost of eighteen shillings two years ago,
    the result being that a smoky chimney is cured, and that the room is
    always at a really comfortable temperature, with a smaller
    consumption of coal than before. The whole of the radiation is into
    the room, with perfect slow combustion."</blockquote>

<br>
  Whenever oil, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, is used for the
  purpose of artificial light, it should be kept free from all exposure
  to atmospheric air; as it is apt to absorb considerable quantities of
  oxygen. If animal oil is very coarse or tenacious, a very small
  quantity of oil of turpentine may be added.

<a name="p1001"></a><b><i>1001. &nbsp;Night Lights</i></b><br>
<br>
Field's and Child's night lights are generally known and are easily
  obtainable. But under circumstances where they cannot be procured, the
  waste of candles may be thus applied. Make a <i>fine</i> cotton, and wax it
  with white wax. Then cut into the requisite lengths. Melt the grease
  and pour into pill boxes, previously either fixing the cotton in the
  centre, or dropping it in just before the grease sets. If a little
  white wax be melted with the grease, all the better. In this manner,
  the ends and drippings of candles may be used up. When set to burn,
  place in a saucer, with sufficient water to rise to the extent of the
  16th of an inch around the base of the night light.

<a name="p1002"></a><b><i>1002. &nbsp;Revolving Ovens</i></b><br>
<br>
  These ovens may be easily made by any tin-man. They are not now
  manufactured for sale, which is to be regretted, on account of their
  obvious utility. When suspended in front of any ordinary fire by means
  of a bottle-jack or a common worsted string, the Revolving Oven will
  bake bread, cakes, pies, &amp;c., in a much more equal and perfect manner
  than either a side oven or an American oven, without depriving the
  room of the heat and comfort of the fire. Before an ordinary fire, in
  any room in the house, it will bake a four-pound loaf in an hour and
  twenty minutes. It also bakes pastry remarkably well, and all the care
  it requires is merely to give it a look now and then to see that it
  keeps turning.<br>
<br>
  <a name="frp1002f1">The</a> bottom of the oven<a href="#p1002f1"><sup>1</sup></a>, is made in the form of two saucers, the
  lower one of which is inverted, while the other stands on it in the
  ordinary position. A rim, from 1 in. to 2 in. in height, is fixed
  round the edge of the upper saucer, but a little within it, and over
  this rim fits a cylinder with a top, slightly domed, which also
  resembles a saucer turned upside-down. In the centre of the top is a
  circular ventilator, through which steam, generated in baking, can
  escape, and the ventilator is covered by a domed plate, as large as
  the top of the oven. This acts as a radiator to reflect heat on the
  top of the oven, and is furnished with a knob, by which the cylinder
  that covers the article to be baked may be removed, in order to view
  the progress of the baking. Two strong wires project from the bottom
  on either side, terminating in loops or eyes for the reception of the
  hooks of a handle, by which the entire apparatus may be suspended in
  front of the fire.<br>

  it, and two quarts of warm water, to half or more of the flour; stir
  well, let it stand to rise, knead up with the rest of the flour, put
  it into or upon tins, and let it stand to rise. Then bake in a
  moderately quick oven. For a first quickening a little German yeast
  will do.

  Whole meal bread may be made by any one who possesses a small hand
  mill that will grind about twenty pounds of wheat at a time. This
  bread is far more nutritious than ordinary bread made from flour from
  which the bran has been entirely separated. The meal thus obtained may
  be used for puddings, &amp;c. There are mills which grind and dress the
  wheat at one operation. Such mills may be obtained at any
  ironmonger's. The saving in the cost of bread amounts to nearly
  one-third, which would soon cover the cost of the mill, and effect a
  most important saving, besides promoting health, by avoiding the evil
  effects of adulterated flour.

<a name="p1008"></a><b><i>1008. &nbsp;Indian Corn Flour and Wheaten Bread</i></b><br>
<br>
  The peculiarity of this bread consists in its being composed in part
  of Indian corn flour, which will be seen by the following analysis by
  the late Professor Johnston, to be much richer in gluten and fatty
  matter than the flour of wheat, to which circumstance it owes its
  highly nutritive character:<br>

  Take of Indian corn flour seven pounds, pour upon it four quarts of
  boiling water, stirring it all the time; let it stand till about
  new-milk warm, then mix it with fourteen pounds of fine wheaten flour,
  to which a quarter of a pound of salt has been previously added. Make
  a depression on the surface of this mixture, and pour into it two
  quarts of yeast, which should be thickened to the consistence of cream
  with some of the flour; let it stand all night; on the following
  morning the whole should be well kneaded, and allowed to stand for
  three hours; then divide it into loaves, which are better baked in
  tins, in which they should stand for half an hour, then bake.
  Thirty-two pounds of wholesome, nutritive, and very agreeable bread
  will be the result. It is of importance that the flour of Indian corn
  should be procured, as Indian corn meal is that which is commonly met
  with at the shops, and the coarseness of the husk in the meal might to
  some persons be prejudicial.

<br>
  To one quartern of flour add a dessertspoonful of salt as before;
  dissolve one ounce of dried German yeast in about three tablespoonfuls
  of cold water, add to this one pint and a half of water a little warm,
  and pour the whole into the flour; knead it well immediately, and let
  it stand as before directed for one hour: then bake at pleasure. It
  will not hurt if you make up a peck of flour at once, and bake three
  or four loaves in succession, provided you do not keep the dough too
  warm. German yeast may be obtained at almost any corn-chandler's in
  the metropolis and suburbs. In winter it will keep good for a week in a
  dry place, and in summer it should be kept in cold water, and the
  water changed every day. Wheat meal requires a little more yeast than
  fine flour, or a longer time to stand in the dough for rising.

<a name="p1010"></a><b><i>1010. &nbsp;Unfermented Bread</i></b><br>
<br>
  Three pounds wheat meal, or four pounds of white flour, two heaped
  tablespoonfuls of baking powder, a tablespoonful of salt, and about
  two and a half pints of lukewarm water, or just sufficient to bring
  the flour to a proper consistence for bread-making; water about a
  quart. The way of making is as follows:<br>
<br>
  First mix the baking powder, the salt, and about three fourths of the
  flour well together by rubbing in a pan; then pour the water over the
  flour, and mix well by stirring. Then add most of the remainder of the
  flour, and work up the dough with the hand to the required
  consistence, which is indicated by the smoothness of the dough, and
  its not sticking to the hands or the sides of the pan when kneaded.
  The rest of the flour must then be added to stiffen the dough, which
  may then be placed in tins or formed by the hand into any shape that
  may be preferred and placed on flat tins for baking.<br>
<br>
  The tins should be well floured. Put the loaves at once into a
  well-heated oven. After they have been in the oven about a quarter of
  an hour open the ventilator to slacken the heat and allow the steam to
  escape. In an hour the process of baking will be completed. Bread made
  in this way keeps moist longer than bread made with yeast, and is far
  more sweet and digestible. This is especially recommended to persons
  who suffer from indigestion, who will find the brown bread invaluable.

<br>
  These useful preparations are now much used in making bread and pastry
  of all kinds, and have the merit of being both cheap and wholesome.
  They may be procured of all grocers and oilmen. The basis of all
  baking powders consists of carbonate of soda and tartaric acid or
  cream of tartar, and egg powders are made of the same materials, with
  a little harmless colouring matter such as turmeric. By the action of
  these substances, carbonic acid is generated in the dough, which
  causes it to rise in the same manner as the so-called "aërated bread "
  made on Dr. Dauglish's system, by which carbonic acid is forced into
  the dough before baking.

  Baking powder may be used instead of yeast in making all kinds of
  bread, cake, teacakes, &amp;c., and for biscuits and pastry, either
  without or in combination with butter, suet, &amp;c. Bread, &amp;c., made with
  baking powder is never placed before the fire to rise as when made
  with yeast, but the dough may be shaped and put into the oven as soon
  as it is made. The chief points to bear in remembrance are that in
  making bread two teaspoonfuls of baking powder should be used to every
  pound of flour, but for pastry, cakes, buns, &amp;c., three teaspoonfuls
  should be used. The ingredients should always be thoroughly
  incorporated by mixing; the tins on which or in which the dough is
  placed to bake should be well floured, and not greased; and the oven
  should always be very hot, so that the baking may be effected as
  rapidly as possible.

  Simmer slowly, over a gentle fire, a pound of rice in three quarts of
  water, till the rice has become perfectly soft, and the water is
  either evaporated or imbibed by the rice: let it become cool, but not
  cold, and mix it completely with four pounds of flour; add to it some
  salt, and about four tablespoonfuls of yeast. Knead it very
  thoroughly, for on this depends whether or not your good materials
  produce a superior article. Next let it rise well before the fire,
  make it up into loaves with a little of the flour&mdash;which, for that
  purpose, you must reserve from your four pounds&mdash;and bake it rather
  long. This is an exceedingly good and cheap bread.

<br>
  Suffer the miller to remove from the flour only the coarse flake bran.
  Of this bran, boil five or six pounds in four and a half gallons of
  water; when the goodness is extracted from the bran,&mdash;during which
  time the liquor will waste half or three-quarters of a gallon,&mdash;strain
  it and let it cool. When it has cooled down to the temperature of new
  milk, mix it with fifty-six pounds of flour and as much salt and yeast
  as would be used for other bread; knead it exceedingly well; let it
  rise before the fire, and bake it in small loaves: small loaves are
  preferable to large ones, because they take the heat more equally.
  There are two advantages in making bread with bran water instead of
  plain water; the one being that there is considerable nourishment in
  bran, which is thus extracted and added to the bread; the other, that
  flour imbibes much more of bran water than it does of plain water; so
  much more, as to give in the bread produced almost a fifth in weight
  more than the quantity of flour made up with plain water would have
  done. These are important considerations to the poor. Fifty-six pounds
  of flour, made with plain water, would produce sixty-nine and a half
  pounds of bread; made with bran water, it will produce eighty-three
  and a half pounds.

  usual way. This plan has been followed for some years: finding that
  bread made according to it is much superior to that made of flour
  only, and on this ground alone we recommend its adoption; but in
  addition to this, taking the high price of flour, and moderately low
  price of potatoes, here is a saving of over twenty per cent., which is

<br>
  It has lately been found that water saturated with lime produces in
  bread the same whiteness, softness, and capacity of retaining
  moisture, as results from the use of alum; while the former removes
  all acidity from the dough, and supplies an ingredient needed in the
  structure of the bones, but which is deficient in the <i>cerealia</i>.  The
  best proportion to use is, five pounds of water saturated with lime,
  to every nineteen pounds of flour. No change is required in the
  process of baking.  The lime most effectually coagulates the gluten,
  and the bread weighs well; bakers must therefore approve of its
  introduction, which is not injurious to the system, like alum, &amp;c.

  small-beer yeast; put them into a pan with flour sufficient to make it
  as thick as batter, &mdash;cover it over, and let it stand till it has
  risen as high as it will, i. e., about two hours: add two ounces of
  lump sugar, dissolved in a quarter of a pint of warm milk, a quarter
  of a pound of butter rubbed into the flour very fine, &mdash;then make the
  dough the same as for French rolls, &amp;c.; let it stand half an hour;
  then make up the cakes, and put them on tins:&mdash;when they have stood to
  rise, bake them in a quick oven. Care should be taken never to mix the
  yeast with water or milk too hot or too cold, as either extreme will
  destroy the fermentation. In summer it should he lukewarm,&mdash;in winter
  a little warmer, &mdash;and in very cold weather, warmer still. When it has
  first risen, if you are not prepared, it will not harm if it stand an
  hour.

<a name="p1026"></a><b><i>1026. &nbsp;The Gridiron</i></b><br>
<br>
  The gridiron, though the simplest of cooking instruments, is by no
  means to be despised.  In common with all cooking utensils the
  Gridiron should be kept scrupulously clean; and when it is used, the
  bars should be allowed to get warm before the meat is placed upon it,
  otherwise the parts crossed by the bars will be insufficiently
  dressed.  The fire should be sharp, clear, and free from smoke. The
  heat soon forms a film upon the surface of the meat, by which the
  juices are retained. Chops and steaks should not be too thick nor too
  thin. From a half to three-quarters of an inch is the proper
  thickness. Avoid thrusting the fork into the meat, by which you
  release the juice. There is a description of gridiron in which the
  bars are grooved to catch the juice of the meat, but a much better
  invention is the upright gridiron, which is attached to the front of
  the grate, and has a pan at the bottom to catch the gravy. Kidneys,
  rashers, &amp;c., dressed in this manner will he found delicious.

<a name="p1027"></a><b><i>1027. &nbsp;The Frying-pan</i></b><br>
<br>
  The frying-pan is a noisy and a greasy servant, requiring much
  watchfulness. Like the Gridiron, the Frying-pan requires a clear but
  not a large fire, and the pan should be allowed to get thoroughly hot,
  and be well covered with fat, before meat is put into it. The
  excellence of frying very much depends upon the sweetness of the oil,
  butter, lard, or fat that may be employed. The Frying-pan is very
  useful in the warming of cold vegetables and other kinds of food, and
  in this respect may be considered a real friend of economy. All know
  the relish afforded by a pancake, to say nothing of eggs and bacon,
  and various kinds of fish, to which both the Saucepan and the Gridiron
  are quite unsuited, because they require that which is the essence of
  frying, <i>boiling and browning in fat</i>.

<a name="p1028"></a><b><i>1028. &nbsp;The Spit </i></b><br>
<br>
  The spit is a very ancient and very useful implement of cookery.
  Perhaps the process of roasting stands only second in the rank of
  excellence in cookery. The process is perfectly sound in its chemical
  effects upon the food, while the joint is kept so immediately under
  the eye of the cook, that it must be the fault of that functionary if
  it does not go to the table in the highest state of perfection. The
  process of roasting should be commenced very slowly, the meat being
  kept a good distance from the fire, and gradually brought forward,
  until it is thoroughly soaked within and browned without. The Spit has
  this advantage over the Oven, and especially over the common oven,
  that the meat retains its own flavour, not having to encounter the
  evaporation from fifty different dishes, and that the steam from its
  own substance passes entirely away, leaving the essence of the meat in
  its primest condition.

<a name="p1029"></a><b><i>1029. &nbsp;The Meat Hook</i></b><br>
<br>
  The meat hook has in the present day superseded the use of the Spit in
  middle class families.  It is thrust into the meat, and the joint
  thereby suspended before the fire. For roasting in this manner the
  lintel of the mantel-piece is furnished with a brass or iron arm,
  turning on pivots in a plate fastened to the lintel, and notched along
  its upper edge. From this arm, which is turned back against the lintel
  when not in use, the meat is hung and turned by means of a bottle-jack
  or a skein of worsted, knotted in three or four places, which answers
  the purpose equally well, and may be replaced by a new one when
  required, at a merely nominal cost. Meat roasted in this manner should
  be turned occasionally, the hook being inserted first at one end and
  then at the other.

<a name="p1030"></a><b><i>1030. &nbsp;The Dutch Oven</i></b><br>
<br>
  The Dutch oven is of great utility for small dishes of various kinds,
  which the Spit would spoil by the magnitude of its operations, or the
  Oven destroy by the severity of its heat. It combines, in fact, the
  advantages of roasting and baking, and may be adopted for compound
  dishes, and for warming cold scraps: it is easily heated, and causes
  no material expenditure of fuel.

<a name="p1031"></a><b><i>1031. &nbsp;The Saucepan</i></b><br>
<br>
  When we come to speak of the Saucepan, we have to consider the claims
  of a very large, ancient, and useful family. There are large
  saucepans, dignified with the name of Boilers, and small saucepans,
  which come under the denomination of Stewpans. There are few kinds of
  meat or fish which the Saucepan will not receive, and dispose of in a
  satisfactory manner; and few vegetables for which it is not adapted.<br>
<br>
  When rightly used, it is a very economical servant, allowing nothing
  to be lost; that which escapes from the meat while in its charge forms
  broth, or may be made the basis of soups. Fat rises upon the surface
  of the water, and may be skimmed off; while in various stews it
  combines, in an eminent degree, what we may term the <i>fragrance</i> of
  cookery, and the <i>piquancy</i> of taste. The French are perfect masters
  of the use of the Stewpan. And we shall find that, as all cookery is
  but an aid to digestion, the operations of the Stewpan resemble the
  action of the stomach very closely. The stomach is a close sac, in
  which solids and fluids are mixed together, macerated in the gastric
  juice, and dissolved by the aid of heat and motion, occasioned by the
  continual contractions and relaxations of the coats of the stomach
  during the action of digestion. This is more closely resembled by the
  process of stewing than by any other of our culinary methods.

    <blockquote>"In the hands of an expert cook," says Majendie, "alimentary
    substances are made almost entirely to change their nature, their
    form, consistence, odour, savour, colour, chemical composition, &amp;c.;
    everything is so modified, that it is often impossible for the most
    exquisite sense of taste to recognise the substance which makes up
    the basis of certain dishes. The greatest utility of the kitchen
    consists in making the food agreeable to the senses, and rendering
    it easy of digestion."</blockquote>

<a name="p1034"></a><b><i>1034. &nbsp;Theory of Cooking</i></b><br>
<br>
  To some extent the claims of either process of cooking depend upon the
  taste of the individual. Some persons may esteem the peculiar flavour
  of fried meats, while others will prefer broils or stews. It is
  important, however, to understand the <i>theory</i> of each method of
  cooking, so that whichever may be adopted, may be done well. Bad
  cooking, though by a good method, is far inferior to good cooking by a
  bad method.

<br>
   A sirloin of about fifteen pounds (if much more in weight the outside
   will be done too much before the inner side is sufficiently roasted),
   will require to be before the fire about three and a half or four
   hours. Take care to spit it evenly, that it may not be heavier on one
   side than the other; put a little clean dripping into the dripping
   pan (tie a sheet of paper over it to preserve the fat) baste it well
   as soon as it is put down, and every quarter of an hour all the time
   it is roasting, till the last half-hour; then take off the paper and
   make some gravy for it, stir the fire and make it clear; to brown and
   froth it, sprinkle a little salt over it, baste it with butter, and
   dredge it with flour; let it go a few minutes longer, till the froth
   rises, take it up, put it on the dish, &amp;c. Garnish it with
   horseradish, scraped as fine as possible with a very sharp knife.

  cooks egg it, and sprinkle it with veal stuffing before rolling it. As
  the meat is in a solid mass, it will require more time at the fire
  than ribs of beef with the bones: a piece of ten or twelve pounds
  weight will not be well and thoroughly roasted in less than four and a
  half or five hours. For the first half-hour it should not be less than
  twelve inches from the fire, that it may get gradually warm to the
  centre; the last half-hour before it is finished, sprinkle a little
  salt over it, and, if you like, flour it, to froth it.

<a name="p1065"></a><b><i>1065. &nbsp;Effectiveness of Roasting</i></b><br>
<br>
  Roasting, by causing the contraction of the cellular substance which
  contains the fat, expels more fat than boiling.  The free escape of
  watery particles in the form of vapour, so necessary to produce
  flavour, must be regulated by frequent basting with the fat which has
  exuded from the meat, combined with a little salt and water&mdash;otherwise
  the meat would burn, and become hard and tasteless. A brisk fire at
  first will, by charring the outside, prevent the heat from
  penetrating, and therefore should only be employed when the meat is
  half roasted.
<br>

<a name="p1066"></a><b><i>1066. &nbsp;The Loss by Roasting (General)</i></b><br>
<br>

  The loss by roasting is said to vary from 14-3/8ths to nearly double
  that rate per cent. The average loss on roasting butcher's meat is 22
  percent.: and on domestic poultry, 20-1/2.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1067"></a><b><i>1067. &nbsp;The Loss by Roasting (Specific)</i></b><br>
<br>
  The loss per cent, on roasting beef, viz., on sirloins and ribs
  together is 19-1/6th; on mutton, viz., legs and shoulders together,
  24-4/5ths, on fore-quarters of lamb, 22-1/3rd; on ducks, 27-1/5th;
  on turkeys, 20-1/2; on geese, 19-1/2; on chickens, 14-3/5ths. So that
  it will be seen by comparison with the percentage given of the loss by
  boiling, that roasting is not so economical; especially when we take
  into account that the loss of weight by boiling is not actual loss of
  economic materials, for we then possess the principal ingredients for
  soups; whereas, after roasting, the fat only remains. The average loss
  in boiling and and roasting together is 18 per cent. according to
  Donovan, and 28 per cent. according to Wallace&mdash;a difference that may
  be accounted for by supposing a difference in the fatness of the meat,
  duration and degree of heat, &amp;c., employed.

<a name="p1068"></a><b><i>1068. &nbsp;Boiling</i></b><br>
<br>
  This most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in
  perfection; it does not require quite so much nicety and attendance as
  roasting; to skim your pot well, and keep it really boiling, or
  rather, simmering, all the while&mdash;to know how long is required for
  doing the joint, &amp;c., and to take it up at the critical moment when it
  is done enough&mdash;comprehends almost the whole art and mystery. This,
  however, demands a patient and perpetual vigilance, of which,
  unhappily, few persons are capable.<br>
<br>
  The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all the
  while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time; and make up
  a sufficient fire (a frugal cook will manage with much less fire for
  boiling than she uses for roasting) at first, to last all the time,
  without much mending or stirring, and thereby save much trouble. When
  the pot is coming to a boil, there will always, from the cleanest meat
  and clearest water, rise a scum to the top of it; proceeding partly
  from the foulness of the meat, and partly from the water: this must be
  carefully taken off, as soon as it rises. On this depends the good
  appearance of all boiled things&mdash;an essential matter.<br>
<br>
  When you have skimmed well, put in some cold water, which will throw
  up the rest of the scum. The oftener it is skimmed, and the clearer
  the surface of the water is kept, the cleaner will be the meat. If let
  alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat, which, instead of
  looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse appearance we
  have too often to complain of, and the butcher and poulterer will be
  blamed for the carelessness of the cook, in not skimming her pot with
  due diligence.<br>
<br>
  Many put in milk, to make what they boil look white, but this does
  more harm than good; others wrap it up in a cloth; but these are
  needless precautions; if the scum be attentively removed, meat will
  have a much more delicate colour and finer flavour than it has when
  muffled up. This may give rather more trouble&mdash;but those we wish to
  excel in their art must only consider how the processes of it can be
  most perfectly performed: a cook who has a proper pride and pleasure
  in her business will make this her maxim and rule on all occasions.<br>
<br>
  Put your meat into cold water, in the proportion of about a quart of
  water to a pound of meat; it should be covered with water during the
  whole of the process of boiling, but not drowned in it; the less
  water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savoury will be
  the meat, and the better will be the broth in every respect. The water
  should be heated gradually, according to the thickness, &amp;c., of the
  article boiled; for instance, a leg of mutton of ten pounds weight
  should be placed over a moderate fire, which will gradually make the
  water hot without causing it to boil, for about forty minutes; if the
  water boils much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up as
  if it was scorched&mdash;by keeping the water a certain time heating
  without boiling, its fibres are dilated, and it yields a quantity of
  scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises, for the reasons
  already mentioned. 

<blockquote>"If a vessel containing water be placed over a steady fire, the
    water will grow continually hotter, till it reaches the limit of
    boiling; after which, the regular accessions of heat are wholly
    spent in converting it into steam: the water remains at the same
    pitch of temperature, however fiercely it boils. The only difference
    is, that with a strong fire it sooner comes to boil, and more
    quickly boils away, and is converted into steam." </blockquote>

  Such are the opinions stated by Buchanan in his "Economy of Fuel."
  There was placed a thermometer in water in that state which cooks call
  gentle simmering&mdash;the heat was 212°, <i>i. e.</i>, the same degree as the
  strongest boiling. Two mutton chops were covered with cold water, and
  one boiled fiercely, and the other simmered gently, for three-quarters
  of an hour; the flavour of the chop which was simmered was decidedly
  superior to that which was boiled; the liquor which boiled fast was in
  like proportion more savoury, and, when cold, had much more fat on its
  surface; this explains why quick boiling renders meat hard,
  &amp;c.&mdash;because its juices are extracted in a greater degree.

<a name="p1069"></a><b><i>1069. &nbsp;Time of Boiling</i></b><br>
<br>
  Reckon the time from the water first coming to a boil. The old rule,
  of fifteen minutes to a pound of meat, is, perhaps, rather too little;
  the slower the meat boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter it
  will be. For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked (which all
  will who have any regard for their stomachs), twenty minutes to a
  pound will not be found too much for gentle simmering by the side of
  the fire; allowing more or less time, according to the thickness of
  the joint and the coldness of the weather; always remembering, the
  slower it boils the better.  Without some practice it is difficult to
  teach any art; and cooks seem to suppose they must be right, if they
  put meat into a pot, and set it over the fire for a certain
  time&mdash;making no allowance, whether it simmers without a bubble, or
  boils at a gallop.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><p align="right"><i><span style="color: #A82C28">A Letter-box Saves Many Knocks.</span></i></p><br>

<a name="p1070"></a><b><i>1070. &nbsp;Before Boiling</i></b><br>
<br>
  Fresh killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that which
  has been kept till it is what the butchers call ripe, and longer in
  cold than in warm weather. If it be frozen it must be thawed before
  boiling as before roasting; if it be fresh killed, it will be tough
  and hard, if you stew it ever so long, and ever so gently. In cold
  weather, the night before you dress it, bring it into a place of which
  the temperature is not less than forty-five degrees of Fahrenheit's
  thermometer.<br>
<br>
  The size of the boiling-pots should be adapted to what they are to
  contain; the larger the saucepan the more room it takes upon the fire;
  and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate increase of
  fire to boil it. In small families block tin saucepans are best, as
  being lightest and safest: moreover, if proper care is taken of them,
  and they are well dried after they are cleansed, they are by far the
  cheapest; the purchase of a new tin saucepan being little more than
  the expense of tinning a copper one. Take care that the covers of your
  boiling-pots fit close, not only to prevent unnecessary evaporation of
  the water, but that the smoke may not insinuate itself under the edge
  of the lid, and give the meat a bad taste.

  Beef and mutton is preferred by some people a little underdone. Very
  large joints if slightly underdone, will make the better hash or
  broil. Lamb, pork, and veal are uneatable if not thoroughly
  boiled&mdash;but these meats should not be overdone. A trivet, a
  fish-drainer, or an American contrivance called a "spider"&mdash;which is
  nothing more than a wire dish raised on three or four short legs&mdash;put
  on the bottom of the boiling-pot, raising the contents about an inch
  and a half from the bottom, will prevent that side of the meat which
  comes next the bottom being done too much; and the lower part will be
  as delicately done as the upper; and this will enable you to take out
  the meat without inserting a fork, &amp;c., into it. If you have not a
  trivet, a drainer, or a "spider," use a soup-plate laid the wrong side
  upwards.

  In most families many members are not fond of fat&mdash;servants seldom
  like it: consequently there is frequently much wasted; to avoid which,
  take off bits of suet fat from beefsteaks, &amp;c., previous to cooking;
  they can be used for puddings. With good management there need be no

<a name="p1081"></a><b><i>1081. &nbsp;Broiling</i></b><br>
<br>
  Broiling requires a brisk, rapid heat, which by producing a greater
  degree of change in the affinities of the raw meat than roasting,
  generates a higher flavour, so that broiled meat is more savoury than
  roast. The surface becoming charred, a dark-coloured crust is formed,
  which retards the evaporation of the juices; and, therefore, if
  properly done, broiled meat may he as tender and juicy as roasted meat.

<a name="p1082"></a><b><i>1082. &nbsp;Baking</i></b><br>
<br>
  Baking does not admit of the evaporation of the vapours so rapidly as
  by the processes of broiling and roasting; the fat is also retained
  more, and becomes converted, by the agency of the heat, into an
  empyreumatic oil, which renders the meat less fitted for delicate
  stomachs, and more difficult to digest. The meat is, in fact, partly
  boiled in its own confined water, and partly roasted by the dry, hot
  air of the oven. The loss by baking has not been estimated and reduced
  to a tabular form.

<a name="p1083"></a><b><i>1083. &nbsp;Frying</i></b><br>
<br>
  Frying is of all methods the most objectionable, from the foods being
  less digestible when thus prepared, as the fat employed undergoes
  chemical changes.  Olive oil in this respect is preferable to lard or
  butter. The crackling noise which accompanies the process of frying
  meat in a pan is occasioned by the explosions of steam formed in fat,
  the temperature of which is much above 212 degrees. If the meat is
  very juicy it will not fry well, because it becomes sodden before the
  water is evaporated; and it will not brown, because the temperature is
  too low to scorch it. To fry fish well the fat should be <i>boiling hot
  (600 degrees),</i> and the fish <i>well dried</i> in a cloth; otherwise, owing
  to the generation of steam the temperature will fall so low that it
  will be boiled in its own steam, and not be browned. Meat, or indeed
  any article, should be frequently turned and agitated during frying to
  promote the evaporation of the watery particles. To make fried things
  look well, they should be done over <i>twice</i> with egg and stale
  bread-crumbs.

  The housewife who is anxious to dress no more meat than will suffice
  for the meal, should remember that beef loses about one pound in four
  in boiling, but in roasting, loses in the proportion of one pound five
  ounces, and in baking about two ounces less, or one pound three
  ounces; mutton loses in boiling about fourteen ounces in four pounds;
  in roasting, one pound six ounces.

  Cooks should be cautioned against the use of charcoal in any quantity,
  except whore there is a free <i>current of air</i>; for charcoal is highly
  prejudicial in a state of ignition, although it may be rendered even
  actively beneficial when boiled, as a small quantity of it, if boiled
  with <i>meat on the turn</i>, will effectually cure the unpleasant taint.

  There is nothing in which the difference between an elegant and an
  ordinary table is more seen, than in the dressing of vegetables, more
  especially of greens; they may be equally as fine at first, at one
  place as at another, but their look and taste are afterwards very
  different, entirely from the careless way in which they have been
  cooked. They are in greatest perfection when in greatest plenty, i. e.,
  when in full season. By season, we do not mean those early days, when
  luxury in the buyers, and avarice in the sellers about London, force
  the various vegetables, but the time of the year in which, by nature
  and common culture, and the mere operation of the sun and climate,
  they are most plenteous and in perfection.

<a name="p1094"></a><b><i>1094. &nbsp;Preparing Vegetables</i></b><br>
<br>
  Take care to wash and cleanse Vegetables thoroughly from dust, dirt,
  and insects&mdash;this requires great attention. Pick off all the outside
  leaves, trim them nicely, and if they are not quite fresh-gathered and
  have become flaccid, it is absolutely necessary to restore their
  crispness before cooking them, or they will be tough and unpleasant.
  To do this, lay them in a pan of clean water, with a handful of salt
  in it, for an hour before you dress them. Most vegetables being more
  or less succulent, it is necessary that they possess their full
  proportion of fluids in order to retain that state of crispness and
  plumpness which they have when growing.

<a name="p1095"></a><b><i>1095. &nbsp;Staleness</i></b><br>
<br>
  On being cut or gathered, the exhalation from their surface continues,
  while from the open vessels of the cut surface there is often great
  exudation or evaporation, and thus their natural moisture is
  diminished; tho tender leaves become flaccid, and the thicker masses
  or roots lose their plumpness.  This is not only less pleasant to the
  eye, but is a serious injury to the nutritious powers of the
  vegetable; for in this flaccid and shrivelled state its fibres are
  less easily divided in chewing, and the water which exists in the form
  of their respective natural juices is less directly nutritious.

  thoroughly before you send them to table. This branch of cookery

  The above recipe is for boiling potatoes in their jackets, as the

  tubers should first be well washed and put in a bowl of clean water.
  As each potato is taken out of this receptacle and peeled, it should
  be thrown into another bowl of cold water, close at hand to receive
  them. This prevents undue discolouration of the potatoes.

  in the saucepan thrown off, and the steamer then replaced, in order to
  allow the process of cooking to be completed. Some people shake the

<br>
  The following receipt will be found an agreeable and wholesome
  dish:&mdash;Lay the cress in strong salt and water, to clear it from
  insects. Pick and wash nicely, and stew it in water for about ten
  minutes; drain and chop, season with pepper and salt, add a little
  butter, and return it to the stewpan until well heated. Add a little
  vinegar previously to serving; put around it sippets of toast or fried
  bread. The above, made thin, as a substitute for parsley and butter,
  will be found an excellent sauce for a boiled fowl. There should be
  considerably more of the cress than of the parsley, as the flavour is
  much milder.

<a name="p1128"></a><b><i>1128. &nbsp;Indications of Wholesome Mushrooms</i></b><br>
<br>
  Whenever a fungus is pleasant, in flavour and odour, it may be
  considered wholesome; if, on the contrary, it have an offensive smell,
  a bitter, astringent, or styptic taste, or even if it leave an
  unpleasant flavour in the mouth, it should not be considered fit for
  food.  The colour, figure, and texture of these vegetables do not
  afford any characters on which we can safely rely; yet it may be
  remarked that in colour the pure yellow, gold colour, bluish pale,
  dark or lustre brown, wine red, or the violet, belong to many that are
  eatable; whilst the pale or sulphur yellow, bright or blood-red, and
  the greenish belong to few but the poisonous. The safe kinds have most
  frequently a compact, brittle texture; the flesh is white; they grow
  more readily in open places, such as dry pastures and waste lands,
  than in places humid or shaded by wood. In general, those should be
  suspected which grow in caverns and subterranean passages, on animal
  matter undergoing putrefaction, as well as those whose flesh is soft
  or watery.

<br>
  Take about eleven pounds of the mouse buttock,&mdash;or clod of beef,&mdash;or
  blade bone,&mdash;or the sticking-piece, or the like weight of the breast
  of veal;&mdash;cut it into pieces of three or four ounces each; put in
  three or four ounces of beef dripping, and mince a couple of large
  onions, and lay them into a large deep stewpan. As soon as it is quite
  hot, flour the meat, put it into the stewpan, continue stirring with a
  wooden spoon; when it has been on about ten minutes, dredge with
  flour, and keep doing so till you have stirred in as much as you think
  will thicken it; then add by degrees about a gallon of boiling water;
  keep stirring it together; skim it when it boils, and then put in one
  drachm of ground black pepper, two of allspice, and two bay-leaves;
  set the pan by the side of the fire, or at a distance over it, and let
  it stew <i>very slowly</i> for about three hours; when you find the meat
  sufficiently tender, put it into a tureen, and it is ready for table.

  put it into cold water, to soak all night; next day wipe it clean, put
  it into a stewpan, and just cover it with water; skim it well when it

  cloves stuck into each, three turnips quartered, a couple of carrots
  sliced, two bay-leaves, and twenty-four corns of allspice, a head of
  celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs, pepper, and salt; lastly, add a
  little cayenne and garlic, if liked.<br>

  a pint and a half of the gravy; add a tablespoonful of mushroom or
  walnut ketchup, or port wine, and boil a short time. Serve up in a

<br>
  When a goose is well picked, singed, and cleaned, make the stuffing,
  with about two ounces of onion&mdash;if you think the flavour of raw onions
  too strong, cut them in slices, and lay them in cold water for a
  couple of hours, add as much apple or potato as you have of onion, and
  half as much green sage, chop them very fine, adding four ounces,
  <i>i. e.</i>, about a large breakfast cupful, of stale breadcrumbs, a bit of
  butter about as big as a walnut, and a very little pepper and salt,
  the yolk of an egg or two, and incorporating the whole well together,
  stuff the goose; do not quite fill it, but leave a little room for the
  stuffing to swell. Spit it, tie it on the spit at both ends, to
  prevent it swinging round, and to prevent the stuffing from coming
  out. From an hour and a half to an hour and three-quarters will roast
  a fine full-grown goose. Send up gravy and apple sauce with it.

<a name="p1168"></a><b><i>1168. &nbsp;Jugged Hare</i></b><br>
<br>
  Wash it very nicely, cut it up in pieces proper to help at table, and
  put them into a jugging-pot, or into a stone jar, just sufficiently
  large to hold it well; put in some sweet herbs, a roll or two of rind
  of a lemon, and a fine large onion with five cloves stuck in it; and,
  if you wish to preserve the flavour of the hare, a quarter of a pint
  of water; but, if you wish to make a ragoût, a quarter of a pint of
  claret or port wine, and the juice of a lemon. Tie the jar down
  closely with a bladder, so that no steam can escape; put a little hay
  in the bottom of the saucepan, in which place the jar; let the water
  boil for about three hours, according to the age and size of the hare,
  keeping it boiling all the time, and till up the pot as it boils away.<br>
<br>
  Care, however, must be taken that it is not overdone, which is the
  general fault in all made dishes. When quite tender, strain off the
  gravy from the fat, thicken it with flour, and give it a boil up; lay
  the pieces of hare in a hash dish, and pour the gravy over it. You may
  make a pudding the same as for roast hare, and boil it in a cloth, and
  when you dish up your hare, cut it in slices, or make forcemeat balls
  of it for garnish. For sauce, red currant jelly.

  for jugging; put it into a stewpan with a few sweet herbs, half a
  dozen cloves, the same of allspice and black pepper, two large onions,
  and a roll of lemon peel; cover it with water: when it boils, skim it
  clean, and let it simmer gently till tender (about two hours); then
  take the meat up with a slice, set it by a fire to keep hot while you
  thicken the gravy; take three ounces of butter and some flour, rub
  together, put in the gravy, stir it well, and let it boil about ten
  minutes; strain it through a sieve over the meat, and it is ready.

  small onions cut up into slices, and let them fry until they are a
  light brown; then add a tablespoonful and a half of curry powder, and
  mix it up well. Now put in the beef, cut into pieces about an inch
  square; pour in from a quarter to a third of a pint of milk, and let
  it simmer for thirty minutes; then take it off, and place it in a
  dish, with a little lemon juice. Whilst cooking stir constantly, to
  prevent it burning. Send to table with a wall of mashed potatoes or
  boiled rice round it. It greatly improves any curry to add with the
  milk a quarter of a cocoa-nut, scraped very small, and squeezed
  through muslin with a little water; this softens the taste of the
  curry, and, indeed, no curry should be made without it.

<a name="p1182"></a><b><i>1182. &nbsp;Curried Oysters</i></b><br>
<br>
  This receipt may be greatly modified, both in quantity and
  ingredients.  Let a hundred of large oysters be opened into a basin
  without losing one drop of their liquor.  Put a lump of fresh butter
  into a good-sized saucepan, and when it boils, add a large onion, cut
  into thin slices, and let it fry in the uncovered stewpan until it is
  of a rich brown: now add a bit more butter, and two or three
  tablespoonfuls of curry powder. When these ingredients are well mixed
  over the fire with a wooden spoon, add gradually either hot water, or
  broth from the stock-pot; cover the stewpan, and let the whole boil
  up. Meanwhile, have ready the meat of a cocoa-nut, grated or rasped
  fine, put this into the stewpan with an unripe apple, chopped. Let the
  whole simmer over the fire until the apple is dissolved, and the
  cocoa-nut very tender; then add a cupful of strong thickening made of
  flour and water, and sufficient salt, as a curry will not bear being
  salted at table. Let this boil up for five minutes.<br>
<br>
  Have ready also a vegetable marrow, or part of one, cut into bits, and
  sufficiently boiled to require little or no further cooking. Put this
  in with a tomato or two. These vegetables improve the flavour of the
  dish, but either or both of them may be omitted. Now put into the
  stewpan the oysters with their liquor, and the milk of the cocoa-nut,
  if it be perfectly sweet; stir them well with the former ingredients;
  let the curry stew gently for a few minutes, then throw in the
  strained juice of half a lemon. Stir the curry from time to time with
  a wooden spoon, and as soon as the oysters are done enough, serve it
  up with a corresponding dish of rice on the opposite side of the
  table. This dish is considered at Madras the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of Indian
  cookery.

  the beards with the liquor of the oysters, and a little white gravy,

  beards, put in the oysters, and thicken the gravy with flour and
  butter (an ounce of butter to half a pint of stew), a little salt,

  cream; some prefer a little essence of anchovy to ketchup, others the
  juice of a lemon, others a glass of white wine; the flavour may be
  varied according to taste. Simmer till the stew is thick, and the

    it up, scrape the under side well, and cut off the rind: grate a
    crust of bread not only on the top, but all over it, as you would
    ham, put it before the fire for a few minutes, not too long, or it
    will dry and spoil it. Bacon is sometimes as salt as salt can make
    it, therefore before it is boiled it must be soaked in warm water
    for an hour or two, changing the water once; then pare off the rusty
    and smoked part, trim it nicely on the under side, and scrape the

  after, if desired,&mdash;cover it close, set it by the side of the fire,

<br>
  This may be made from shin of beef, which should not be large or
  coarse.  The meat will be found serviceable for the table.  From ten
  pounds of the meat let the butcher cut off five or six from the thick
  fleshy part, and again divide the knuckle, that the whole may lie
  compactly in the vessel in which it is to be stewed. Pour in three
  quarts of cold water, and when it has been brought slowly to boil, and
  been well skimmed, throw in an ounce and a half of salt, half a large
  teaspoonful of peppercorns, eight cloves, two blades of mace, a faggot
  of savoury herbs, a couple of small carrots, and the heart of a root
  of celery; to these add a mild onion or not, at choice.<br>
<br>
  When the whole has stewed very softly for four hours, probe the large
  bit of beef, and, if quite tender, lift it out for table; let the soup
  he simmered from two to three hours longer, and then strain it through
  a fine sieve, into a clean pan. When it is perfectly cold, clear off
  every particle of fat: heat a couple of quarts; stir in, when it
  boils, half an ounce of sugar, a small tablespoonful of good soy, and
  twice as much of Harvey's sauce, or, instead of this, of clear and
  fine mushroom ketchup. If carefully made, the soup will be perfectly
  transparent, and of good colour and flavour. A thick slice of ham will
  improve it, and a pound or so of the neck of beef with an additional
  pint of water, will likewise enrich its quality. A small quantity of
  good broth may be made of the fragments of the whole, boiled down with

<br>
  Scrape and wash half a dozen large carrots; peel off the red outside
  (which is the only part used for this soup); put it into a gallon
  stewpan, with one head of celery, and an onion cut into thin pieces;
  take two quarts of beef, veal, or mutton broth, or liquor in which
  mutton or beef has been boiled, as the foundation for this soup. Stock
  that is equally good may be made by boiling down some cold roast
  mutton or beef bones. When you have put the broth to the roots, cover
  the stewpan close, and set it on a slow stove for two hours and a
  half, when the carrots will be soft enough. At this stage some cooks
  put in a teacupful of bread-crumbs. Next boil the soup for two or
  three minutes; rub it through a tammy or hair sieve, with a wooden
  spoon, and add as much broth as will make it a proper thickness,
  <i>i. e.</i>, almost as thick as pea soup; put it into a clean stewpan, make
  it hot and serve.

  by Francatelli in his "Cook's Guide":

  <blockquote>  "Rub the scaly cuticle off the legs with a cloth; trim away the
    claws and spurs; cut off the neck close up to the back, leaving the
    skin of the breast entire; wipe the pheasant clean and truss it in
    the following manner, viz.:&mdash;Place the pheasant upon its breast, run
    a trussing needle and string through the left pinion (the wings
    being removed); then turn the bird over on its back, and place the
    thumb and forefinger of the left hand across the breast, holding the
    legs erect; thrust the needle through the middle joint of both
    thighs, draw it out and then pass it through the other pinion, and
    fasten the strings at the back; next pass the needle through the
    hollow of the back, just below the thighs, thrust it again through
    the legs and body and tie the strings tightly; this will give it an
    appearance of plumpness." </blockquote>

<br>
  Bone as many partridges as the size of pie to be made may require. Put
  a whole raw truffle, peeled, into each partridge, and fill up the
  remaining space in each bird with good forcemeat. Make a raised crust;
  lay a few slices of veal in the bottom, and a thick layer of
  forcemeat; then the partridges, and four truffles to each partridge;
  then cover the partridges and truffles over with sheets of bacon,
  cover the pie in, and finish it. It will take four hours baking.<br>
<br>
  Cut two pounds of lean ham (if eight partridges are in the pie) into
  very thin slices, put it in a stewpan along with the bones and giblets
  of the partridges, and any other loose giblets that are at hand, an
  old fowl, a faggot of thyme and parsley, a little mace, and about
  twenty-four shalots: add about a pint of stock. Set the stewpan on a
  stove to simmer for half an hour, then put in three quarts of good
  stock; let it boil for two hours, then strain it off, and reduce the
  liquid to one pint; add sherry wine to it, and put aside till the pie
  is baked.<br>
<br>
  When the pie has been out of the oven for half an hour, boil the
  residue strained from the bones &amp;c., of the partridges, and put it
  into the pie. Let it stand for twenty-four hours before it is
  eaten.&mdash;<i>Do not take, any of the fat from the pie, as that is what
  preserves it.</i> A pie made in this manner will be eatable for three
  months after it is cut; in short, it cannot spoil in any reasonable

  pickle, cut off the root and horny part at the tip, wipe dry, and boil

  length, and lay a fair proportion of the following mixture within

  salt two tablespoonfuls, and twelve Spanish olives. The olives should
  be stoned, and all the ingredients well pounded and mixed together.
  Next take a barn-door fowl and a good large goose, and bone them. Put
  the tongue inside the fowl, rub the latter outside with the seasoning,
  and having ready some slices of ham divested of the rind, wrap them

<a name="p1266"></a><b><i>1266. &nbsp;Salad</i></b><br>
<br>
  The mixing of salad is an art which it is easy to attain with care.
  The main point is to incorporate the several articles required for the
  salad, and to serve up at table as fresh as possible.  The herbs
  should be "morning gathered," and they will be much refreshed by
  laying an hour or two in spring water. Careful picking, and washing,
  and drying in a cloth, in the kitchen, are also very important, and
  the due proportion of each herb requires attention.<br>
<br>
  The sauce may be thus prepared:&mdash;Boil two eggs for ten or twelve
  minutes, and then put them in cold water for a few minutes, so that
  the yolks may become quite cold and hard. Rub them through a coarse
  sieve with a wooden spoon, and mix them with a tablespoonful of water
  or cream, and then add two tablespoonfuls of fine flask oil, or melted
  butter; mix, and add by degrees a teaspoonful of salt, and the same
  quantity of mustard: mix till smooth, and then incorporate with the
  other ingredients about three tablespoonfuls of vinegar.<br>
<br>
  Pour this sauce down the side of the salad bowl, but do not stir up
  the salad till wanted to be eaten. Garnish the top of the salad with
  the white of the eggs, cut in slices; or these may be arranged in such
  manner as to be ornamental on the table. Some persons may fancy they
  are able to prepare a salad without previous instruction, but, like
  everything else, a little knowledge in this case is not thrown away.

  tablespoonfuls of good salad oil and one of Orléans vinegar, and turn
  over the lettuce lightly with a salad spoon and fork, that every

<a name="p1310"></a><b><i>1310. &nbsp;Miss Acton's Observations on Omelettes, Pancakes, Fritters, &amp;c.</i></b><br>
<br>
    "There is no difficulty in making good omelettes, pancakes, or
    fritters; and, as they may be expeditiously prepared and served,
    they are often a very convenient resource when, on short notice, an
    addition is required to a dinner. The eggs for all of them should be
    well and lightly whisked; the lard for frying batter should be
    extremely pure in flavour, and quite hot when the fritters are
    dropped in; the batter itself should be smooth as cream, and it
    should be briskly beaten the instant before it is used. All fried
    pastes should be perfectly drained from the fat before they are
    served, and sent to table promptly when they are ready.<br>
<br>
    Eggs may be dressed in a multiplicity of ways, but are seldom more
    relished in any form than in a well-made and expeditiously served
    omelette. This may be plain, or seasoned with minced herbs and a
    very little shalot, when the last is liked, and is then called
    <i>Omelettes aux fines herbes</i>; or it may be mixed with minced ham or
    grated cheese: in any case it should be light, thick, full-tasted,
    and <i>fried only on one side</i>; if turned in the pan, as it frequently
    is in England, it will at once be flattened and rendered tough.
    Should the slight rawness, which is sometimes found in the middle of
    the inside when the omelette is made in the French way, be objected
    to, a heated shovel, or a salamander, may be held over it for an
    instant, before it is folded on the dish.<br>
<br>
    The pan for frying it should be quite small; for if it be composed
    of four or five eggs only, and then put into a large one, it will
    necessarily spread over it and be thin, which would render it more
    like a pancake than an omelette; the only partial remedy for this,
    when a pan of proper size cannot be had, is to raise the handle of
    it high, and to keep the opposite side close down to the fire, which
    will confine the eggs into a smaller space. No gravy should be
    poured into the dish with it, and, indeed, if properly made, it will
    require none. Lard is preferable to butter for frying batter, as it
    renders it lighter; but it must not be used for omelettes. Filled
    with preserves of any kind, it is called a sweet omelette."

<br>
  Take twelve large baking pears; pare and cut them into halves, leaving
  on about half an inch of the stem. Take out the core with the point of
  a knife, and place the pears thus prepared close together in a block
  tin saucepan, the inside of which is quite bright, and whose cover
  fits quite close. Put to them the rind of a lemon cut thin, with half
  its juice, a small stick of cinnamon, and twenty grains of allspice;
  cover them with spring water, and allow one pound of loaf sugar to a
  pint and a half of water: cover up close, and bake for six hours in a
  very slow oven;&mdash;they will be quite tender, and of a good colour.
  Prepared cochineal is generally used for colouring the pears; but if
  the above is strictly attended to, it will be found to answer best.

<a name="p1317"></a><b><i>1317. &nbsp;In both Scalds and Burns</i></b><br>
<br>
  In both scalds and burns, the following facts cannot be too firmly
  impressed on the mind of the reader, that in either of these accidents
  the <i>first, best</i>, and <i>often the only remedies required</i>, are sheets
  of wadding, fine wool, or carded cotton, and in default of these,
  violet powder, flour, magnesia, or chalk. The object for which these
  several articles are employed is the same in each instance; namely, to
  exclude the air from the injured part; for if the air can be
  effectually shut out from the raw surface, and care is taken not to
  expose the tender part till the new cuticle is formed, the cure may be
  safely left to nature.<br>
<br>
  The moment a person is called to a case of scald or burn, he should
  cover the part with a sheet, or a portion of a sheet, of wadding,
  taking care not to break any blister that may have formed, or stay to
  remove any burnt clothes that may adhere to the surface, but as
  quickly as possible envelope every part of the injury from all access
  of the air, laying one or two more pieces of wadding on the first, so
  as effectually to guard the burn or scald from the irritation of the
  atmosphere; and if the article used is wool or cotton, the same
  precaution, of adding more material where the surface is thinly
  covered, must be adopted; a light bandage finally securing all in
  their places.<br>
<br>
  Any of the popular remedies recommended below may be employed when
  neither wool, cotton, nor wadding are to be procured, it being always
  remembered that that article which will best exclude the air from a
  burn or scald is the best, quickest, and least painful mode of
  treatment. And in this respect nothing has surpassed cotton loose or
  attached to paper as in wadding.

<a name="p1318"></a><b><i>1318. &nbsp;If the Skin is much Injured</i></b><br>
<br>
  If the skin is much injured in burns, spread some linen pretty thickly
  with chalk ointment, and lay over the part, and give the patient some
  brandy and water if much exhausted; then send for a medical man. If
  not much injured, and very painful, use the same ointment, or apply
  carded cotton dipped in lime water and linseed oil. If you please, you
  may lay cloths dipped in ether over the parts, or cold lotions. Treat
  scalds in the same manner, or cover with scraped raw potato; but the
  chalk ointment is the best. In the absence of all these, cover the
  injured part with treacle, and dust over it plenty of flour.

<br>
  Place your forefinger upon the cheek-bone, having the patient before
  you; then slightly bend the finger, this will draw down the lower lid
  of the eye, and you will probably be able to remove the dirt; but if
  this will not enable you to get at it, repeat this operation while you
  have a netting-needle or bodkin placed over the eyelid; this will turn
  it inside out, and enable you to remove the sand, or eyelash, &amp;c.,
  with the corner of a fine silk handkerchief. As soon as the substance
  is removed, bathe the eye with cold water, and exclude the light for a
  day. If the inflammation is severe, let the patient take a purgative,
  and use a refrigerant lotion.

  taking up the metallic particle, using a lotion made by dissolving six
  grains of sugar of lead, and the same of white vitriol, in six ounces
  of water, and bathing the eye three times a day till the inflammation
  subsides. Another plan is&mdash;Drop a solution of sulphate of copper (from
  one to three grains of the salt to one ounce of water) into the eye,
  or keep the eye open in a wineglassful of the solution.  Take a
  purgative, bathe with cold lotion, and exclude light to keep down
  inflammation.

<br>
  This is frequently produced by a fall. Make a clove hitch, by passing

  the thumb. Afterwards apply a cold lotion.

<a name="p1324"></a><b><i>1324. &nbsp;Cuts and Wounds</i></b><br>
<br>
  Clean cut wounds, whether deep or superficial, and likely to heal by
  the first intention, should never be washed or cleaned, but at once
  evenly and smoothly closed by bringing both edges close together, and
  securing them in that position by adhesive plaster. Cut thin strips of
  sticking-plaster, and bring the parts together; or if large and deep,
  cut two broad pieces, so as to look like the teeth of a comb, and
  place one on each side of the wound, which must be cleaned previously.
   These pieces must be arranged so that they shall interlace one
  another; then, by laying hold of the pieces on the right side with one
  hand, and those on the other side with the other hand, and pulling
  them from one another, the edges of the wound are brought together
  without any difficulty.

<a name="p1325"></a><b><i>1325. &nbsp;Ordinary Cuts</i></b><br>
<br>
  Ordinary cuts are dressed by thin strips, applied by pressing down the
  plaster on one side of the wound, and keeping it there and pulling in
  the opposite direction; then suddenly depressing the hand when the
  edges of the wound are brought together.

<br>
  Contusions are best healed by laying a piece of folded lint, well
  wetted with the extract of lead, on the part, and, if there is much
  pain, placing a hot bran poultice over the dressing, repeating both,
  if necessary, every two hours. When the injuries are very severe, lay
  a cloth over the part, and suspend a basin over it filled with cold
  lotion. Put a piece of cotton into the basin, so that it shall allow
  the lotion to drop on the cloth, and thus keep it always wet.

<a name="p1327"></a><b><i>1327. &nbsp;Hæmorrhage</i></b><br>
<br>
  Hæmorrhage, when caused by an artery being divided or torn, may be
  known by the blood issuing out of the wound in leaps or jerks, and
  being of a bright scarlet colour. If a vein is injured, the blood is
  darker and flows continuously. To arrest the latter, apply pressure by
  means of a compress and bandage. To arrest arterial bleeding, get a
  piece of wood (part of a mop handle will do), and tie a piece of tape
  to one end of it; then tie a piece of tape loosely over the arm, and
  pass the other end of the wood under it; twist the stick round and
  round until the tape compresses the arm sufficiently to arrest the
  bleeding, and then confine the other end by tying the string round the
  arm. A compress made by enfolding a penny piece in several folds of
  lint or linen, should, however, be first placed under the tape and
  over the artery.<br>
<br>
  If the bleeding is very obstinate, and it occurs in the <i>arm</i>, place a
  cork underneath the string, on the inside of the fleshy part, where
  the artery may be felt beating by any one; if in the <i>leg</i>, place a
  cork in the direction of a line drawn from the inner part of the knee
  towards the outer part of the groin. It is an excellent thing to
  accustom yourself to find out the position of these arteries, or,
  indeed, any that are superficial, and to explain to every person in
  your house where they are, and how to stop bleeding.<br>
<br>
  If a stick cannot be got, take a handkerchief, make a cord bandage of
  it, and tie a knot in the middle; the knot acts as a compress, and
  should be placed over the artery, while the two ends are to be tied
  around the thumb. Observe <i>always to place the ligature between the
  wound and the heart</i>. Putting your finger into a bleeding wound, and
  making pressure until a surgeon arrives, will generally stop violent
  bleeding.

<br>
  Bleeding from the nose, from whatever cause, may generally be stopped
  by putting a plug of lint into the nostrils, if this does not do,
  apply a cold lotion to the forehead; raise the head, and place over it
  both arms, so that it will rest on the hands; dip the lint plug,
  <i>slightly moistened</i>, into some powdered gum arabic, and plug the
  nostrils again; or dip the plug into equal parts of powdered gum
  arabic and alum, and plug the nose. Or the plug may be dipped in
  Friar's balsam, or tincture of kino. Heat should be applied to the
  feet; and, in obstinate cases, the sudden shock of a cold key, or cold
  water poured down the spine, will often instantly stop the bleeding.
  If the bowels are confined, take a purgative.

    the face, and all the rubbing carried on under the sheet or blanket.

    with a blanket, and the body placed in such a manner on them, that

<br>
  A poison is a <i>substance</i> which is capable of altering or destroying
  some or all of the functions necessary to life. When a person is in
  good health, and is suddenly attacked, after having taken some food or
  drink, with violent pain, cramp in the stomach, feeling of sickness or
  nausea, vomiting, convulsive twitchings, and a sense of suffocation;
  or if he be seized, under the same circumstances, with giddiness,
  delirium, or unusual sleepiness, then it may be supposed that he has
  been poisoned.

<a name="p1368"></a><b><i>1368. &nbsp;Cautions for the Prevention of Accidents</i></b><br>
<br>
The following regulations should be engraved on the memory of all:
<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    As many sudden deaths come by water, particular caution is
    therefore necessary in its vicinity.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    Do not stand near a tree, or any leaden spout, iron gate, or
    palisade, in times of lightning.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Lay loaded guns in safe places, and never imitate firing a gun
    in jest.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Never sleep near charcoal; if drowsy at any work where charcoal
    fires are used, take the fresh air.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

   Carefully rope trees before they are cut down, that when they
    fall they may do no injury.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    When benumbed with cold beware of sleeping out of doors; rub
    yourself, if you have it in your power, with snow, and do not
    hastily approach the fire.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    Beware of damp.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    Air vaults, by letting them remain open some time before you
    enter, or scattering powdered lime in them. Where a lighted candle
    will not burn, animal life cannot exist; it will be an excellent
    caution, therefore, before entering damp and confined places, to try
    this simple experiment.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    Never leave saddle or draught horses, while in use, by
    themselves; nor go immediately behind a led horse, as he is apt to
    kick. When crossing a roadway always go behind a cart or carriage,
    never in front of it.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    Do not ride on footways.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    Look closely after children, whether they are up or in bed; and
    particularly when they are near the fire, an element with which they
    are very apt to amuse themselves.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    Leave nothing poisonous open or accessible; and never omit to
    write the word "POISON" in large letters upon it, wherever it may be
    placed.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    In walking the streets keep out of the line of the cellars,
    and never look one way and walk another.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    Never throw pieces of orange peel, or broken glass bottles,
    into the streets.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    Never meddle with gunpowder by candle-light.</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>

    In trimming a lamp with naphtha, never fill it. Leave space for
    the spirit to expand with warmth.</li></ol>

<ol start=17 type="i"><li>

    Never quit a room leaving the poker in the fire.</li></ol>

<ol start=18 type="i"><li>

    When the brass rod of the stair-carpet becomes loose, fasten
    it immediately.</li></ol>

<ol start=19 type="i"><li>

    In opening effervescing drinks, such as soda water, hold the
    cork in your hand.</li></ol>

<ol start=20 type="i"><li>

    Quit your house with care on a frosty morning.</li></ol>

<ol start=21 type="i"><li>

    Have your horses' shoes roughed directly there are indications
    of frost.</li></ol>

<ol start=22 type="i"><li>

    Keep lucifer matches in their cases, and never let them be
    strewed about.</li></ol>

<ol start=23 type="i"><li>

    Kick into the gutter any piece of orange peel that you may
    see on the pavement or the roadway. By so doing you may save many
    from meeting with dangerous accidents.</li></ol>

<ol start=24 type="i"><li>

    Never allow your servants to leave brooms, brushes,
    slop-pails, water cans, &amp;c. in outside doorways, or at the head of a
    flight of stairs when engaged in house-work.</li></ol>

<br>
  It is safer, as a general rule, to keep your place than to jump out.
  Getting out of a gig over the back, provided you can hold on a little
  while, and run, is safer than springing from the side. But it is best
  to keep your place, and hold fast. In accidents people act not so much
  from reason as from excitement: but good rules, firmly impressed upon
  the mind, generally rise uppermost, even in the midst of fear.

<a name="p1370"></a><b><i>1370. &nbsp;Life Belts</i></b><br>
<br>
  An excellent and cheap life belt, for persons proceeding to sea,
  bathing in dangerous places, or learning to swim, may be thus
  made:&mdash;Take a yard and three quarters of strong jean, double, and
  divide it into nine compartments. Let there be a space of two inches
  after each third compartment. Fill the compartments with very fine
  cuttings of cork, which may be made by cutting up old corks, or (still
  better) purchased at the corkcutter's. Work eyelet holes at the bottom
  of each compartment, to let the water drain out. Attach a neck-band
  and waist-strings of stout boot-web, and sew them on strongly.

<a name="p1371"></a><b><i>1371. &nbsp;Another</i></b><br>
<br>
  Cut open an old boa, or victorine, and line it with fine cork-cuttings
  instead of wool. For ladies going to sea these are excellent, as they
  may be worn in stormy weather, without giving appearance of alarm in
  danger. They may be fastened to the body by ribands or tapes, of the
  colour of the fur.  Gentlemen's waistcoats may be lined the same way.

  immediately; also apply mustard or hartshorn to the soles of the feet.

<br>
  Do not visit the sick when you are fatigued, or when in a state of
  perspiration, or with the stomach empty&mdash;for in such conditions you
  are liable to take the infection. When the disease is very contagious,
  place yourself at the side of the patient which is nearest to the
  window. Do not enter the room the first thing in the morning, before
  it has been aired; and when you come away, take some food, change your
  clothing immediately, and expose the latter to the air for some days.

<br>
  Serious accidents having occurred to babies through their catching
  hold of the blades of sharp instruments, the following hint will be
  useful. If a child lay hold of a knife or razor, do not try to pull it
  away, or to force open the hand; but, holding the child's hand that is
  empty, offer to its other hand anything nice or pretty, and it will
  immediately open the hand, and let the dangerous instrument fall.

<a name="p1375"></a><b><i>1375. &nbsp;Directing Letters</i></b><br>
<br>
  It may sound like being over particular, but we recommend persons to
  make a practice of fully addressing notes, &amp;c., on all occasions;
  when, in case of their being dropped by careless messengers (which is
  not a rare occurrence), it is evident for whom they are intended,
  without undergoing the inspection of any other person bearing a
  similar name.

<br>
  The following simple suggestions are worthy of observation:<br>
<br>
  Add one ounce of alum to the last water used to rinse children's
  dresses, and they will be rendered uninflammable, or so slightly
  combustible that in event of coming into contact with fire, they would
  only smoulder away very slowly, and not burst into flame. This is a
  simple precaution, which may be adopted in families of children. Bed
  curtains, and linen in general, may also be treated in the same way.
  Tungstate of soda has been recommended for the purpose of rendering
  any article of female dress incombustible. Any chemist will intimate
  to the purchaser the manner in which the tungstate of soda should be
  employed.

<br>
  Every person should endeavour to acquire the power of swimming. The
  fact that the exercise is a healthful accompaniment of bathing, and
  that lives may be saved by it, even when least expected, is a
  sufficient argument for the recommendation. The art of swimming is, in
  reality, very easy. The first consideration is not to attempt to learn
  to swim too hastily. That is to say, you must not expect to succeed in
  your efforts to swim, until you have become accustomed to the water,
  and have overcome your repugnance to the coldness and novelty of
  bathing. Every attempt will fail until you have acquired a certain
  confidence in the water, and then the difficulty will soon vanish.

<a name="p1398"></a><b><i>1398. &nbsp;Dr. Franklin's Advice to Swimmers</i></b><br>
<br>
    "The only obstacle to improvement in this necessary and
    life-preserving art is fear: and it is only by overcoming this
    timidity that you can expect to become a master of the following
    acquirements. It is very common for novices in the art of swimming
    to make use of cork or bladders to assist in keeping the body above
    water; some have utterly condemned the use of them; however, they
    may be of service for supporting the body while one is learning what
    is called the stroke, or that manner of drawing in and striking out
    the hands and feet that is necessary to produce progressive motion.
    But you will be no swimmer till you can place confidence in the
    power of the water to support you; I would, therefore, advise the
    acquiring that confidence in the first place; especially as I have
    known several who, by a little practice, necessary for that purpose,
    have insensibly acquired the stroke, taught, as it were, by nature.<br>
<br>
    The practice I mean is this: choosing a place where the water
    deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is up to your breast;
    then turn round your face to the shore, and throw an egg into the
    water between you and the shore; it will sink to the bottom and be
    easily seen there if the water be clear. It must lie in the water so
    deep that you cannot reach to take it up but by diving for it. To
    encourage yourself in order to do this, reflect that your progress
    will be from deep to shallow water, and that at any time you may, by
    bringing your legs under you, and standing on the bottom, raise your
    head far above the water; then plunge under it with your eyes open,
    which must be kept open on going under, as you cannot open the
    eyelids for the weight of water above you; throwing yourself toward
    the egg, and endeavouring by the action of your hands and feet
    against the water to get forward, till within reach of it.<br>
<br>
    In this attempt you will find that the water buoys you up against
    your inclination; that it is not so easy to sink as you imagine, and
    that you cannot, but by active force, get down to the egg. Thus you
    feel the power of water to support you, and learn to confide in that
    power, while your endeavours to overcome it, and reach the egg,
    teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and
    hands, which action is afterwards used in swimming to support your
    head higher above the water, or to go forward through it.

  time, being desirous of amusing myself with my kite, and enjoying at
  the same time the pleasure of swimming, I returned, and loosening from
  the stake the string, with the little stick which was fastened to it,
  went again into the water, where I found that, lying on my back, and
  holding the stick in my hand, I was drawn along the surface of the
  water in a very agreeable manner. Having then engaged another boy to
  carry my clothes round the pond, to a place which I pointed out to him
  on the other side, I began to cross the pond with my kite, which
  carried me quite over without the least fatigue, and with the greatest

  in my course, and resist its progress, when it appeared that by
  following too quickly, I lowered the kite too much; by doing which

<br>
  When <i>alabaster, marble,</i> and other <i>stones</i> are coloured, and the
  stain is required to be deep, it should be poured on boiling hot, and
  brushed equally over every part, if made with water; if with spirit,
  it should be applied cold, otherwise the evaporation, being too rapid,
  would leave the colouring matter on the surface, without any, or very
  little, being able to penetrate. In greyish or brownish stones, the
  stain will be wanting in brightness, because the natural colour
  combines with the stain; therefore, if the stone be a pure colour, the
  result will be a combination of the colour and stain.<br>
<br>
  In staining <i>bone</i> or <i>ivory</i>, the colours will take better before
  than after polishing; and if any dark spots appear, they should be
  rubbed with chalk, and the article dyed again, to produce uniformity
  of shade. On removal from the boiling hot dye-bath, the bone should be
  immediately plunged into cold water, to prevent cracks from the heat.<br>
<br>
  If <i>paper</i> or <i>parchment</i> is stained, a broad varnish brush should be
  employed, to lay the colouring on evenly.<br>
<br>
  When the stains for <i>wood</i> are required to be very strong, it is
  better to soak and <i>not</i> brush them; therefore, if for inlaying or
  fine work, the wood should be previously split or sawn into proper
  thicknesses; and when it is necessary to brush the wood several times
  over with the stains, it should be allowed to dry between each
  coating.<br>
<br>
  When it is wished to render any of the stains more durable and
  beautiful, the work should be well rubbed with Dutch or common rushes
  after it is coloured, and then varnished with seed-lac varnish, or if
  a better appearance is desired, with three coats of the same, or
  shell-lac varnish. Common work only requires frequent rubbing with
  linseed oil and woollen rags. The remainder, with the exception of
  <i>glass</i>, will be treated in the following sections:

<br>
<a name="p1441"></a><b><i>1441. &nbsp;Hiring and Dismissal</i></b><br>
<br>
  It is customary with respect to domestic servants, that if the terms
  are not otherwise defined, the hiring is by the month, and may be put
  an end to by either party giving a month's warning; or, at the will of
  the employer, a month's wages.

<a name="p1442"></a><b><i>1442. &nbsp;Dismissal</i></b><br>
<br>
  An employer may dismiss a servant upon paying wages for one month
  beyond the date of actual dismissal, the wages without service being
  deemed equivalent to the extra board and lodging with service.
<br>

<a name="p1443"></a><b><i>1443. &nbsp;Distinctions</i></b><br>
<br>
  There are Distinctions with respect to clerks, and servants of a
  superior class. A month's warning or wages will not determine the
  engagements of servants of this class.

<a name="p1444"></a><b><i>1444. &nbsp;Terms</i></b><br>
<br>
  The Terms on which clerks and superior servants are employed being
  very various, it is desirable to have some specific agreement, or
  other proof of the conditions of service and wages.

<a name="p1446"></a><b><i>1446. &nbsp;Terms of Agreement</i></b><br>
<br>
  The Terms of an Agreement should be distinctly expressed, and be
  signed by both parties. And the conditions under which the agreement
  may be terminated by either party should be fully stated.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<br>
  Every Agreement should bear Evidence of Mutuality of interest. If one
  party agrees to stay with another, and give gratuitous services, with
  the view of acquiring knowledge of a business, and the other party
  does not agree to employ and to <i>teach</i>, the agreement is void, as
  being without consideration.

<br>
  But this does not interfere with the Right of an Employer to determine
  a contract for services in those cases where terms of discharge are
  specified in the contract of hiring. In such cases, inability to

<br>
  When a Master becomes Bankrupt, the wages or salary of any clerk or

<br>
  A lease is a conveyance of premises or lands for a specified term of
  years, at a yearly rent, with definite conditions as to alterations,
  repairs, payment of rent, forfeiture, &amp;c. Being an instrument of much
  importance, it should always be drawn by a respectable attorney, who
  will see that all the conditions, in the interest of the lessee, are
  fulfilled.

<a name="p1473"></a><b><i>1473. &nbsp;Precaution</i></b><br>
<br>
  In taking a lease, the tenant's solicitor should carefully examine the
  covenants, or if he take an underlease, he should ascertain the
  covenants of the original lease, otherwise, when too late, he may find
  himself so restricted in his occupation that the premises may be
  wholly useless for his purpose, or he may be involved in perpetual
  difficulties and annoyances; for instance, he may find himself
  restricted from making alterations convenient or necessary for his
  trade; he may find himself compelled to rebuild or pay rent in case of
  fire; he may find himself subject to forfeiture of his lease, or other
  penalty, if he should underlet or assign his interest, carry on some
  particular trade, &amp;c.
<br>

<a name="p1474"></a><b><i>1474. &nbsp;Covenants</i></b><br>
<br>
  The covenants on the landlord's part are usually for the quiet
  enjoyment of the premises by the lessee. On the tenant's part, they
  are usually to pay the rent and taxes; to keep the premises in
  suitable repair; and to deliver up possession when the term has
  expired.

<a name="p1475"></a><b><i>1475. &nbsp;Rent and Taxes</i></b><br>
<br>
  The lessee covenants to pay the rent and all taxes, except the land
  and property taxes, which may be deducted from the rent.

<a name="p1476"></a><b><i>1476. &nbsp;Assignments</i></b><br>
<br>
  Unless there be a covenant against assignment, a lease may be
  assigned, that is, the whole interest of the lessee may be conveyed to
  another, or it may be underlet; if, therefore, it is intended that it
  should not, it is proper to insert a covenant to restrain the lessee
  from assigning or underletting.  Tenants for terms of years may assign
  or underlet, but tenants at will cannot.

<br>
  A tenant who covenants to keep a house in repair is not answerable for
  its natural decay, but is bound to keep it wind and water tight, so
  that it does not decay for want of cover. A lessee who covenants to
  pay rent and keep the premises in repair, is liable to pay the rent
  although the premises may be burned down, unless a stipulation to the
  contrary be inserted in the lease.

<br>
  If a landlord covenant to repair, and neglect to do so, the tenant may
  do it, and withhold so much of the rent. But it is advisable that
  notice thereof should be given by the tenant to the landlord, in the
  presence of a witness, prior to commencing the repairs.

  A tenant must deliver up possession at the expiration of the term (the

  as tenant by sufferance without any new contract; but if the landlord
  recognises such tenancy by accepting a payment of rent after the lease
  has expired, such acceptance will constitute a tenancy; but previous
  to accepting rent, the landlord may bring his ejectment without
  notice; for, the lease having expired, the tenant is a trespasser. A
  lease covenanted to be void if the rent be not paid upon the day
  appointed, is good, unless the landlord make an entry.

An opinion is very generally entertained, however, that a quarter's
  warning to quit, where the house is of small rental, is sufficient
  notice; but where the rent is payable quarterly, or at longer
  intervals, this is a mistake, for unless a special agreement is made
  defining the time to be given as a warning, six months' notice to quit
  must be given, to expire on the same day of the year upon which the
  tenancy commenced. Where the rent is payable weekly or monthly, the
  notice to quit will be good if given for the week or month, provided
  care be taken that it expires upon the day of the week or month of the
  beginning of the tenancy.

  Distress is the most efficient remedy to recover rent, but care should
  be taken that it be done legally; if the distress be illegal, the
  party aggrieved has a remedy by action for damages. Excessive
  distresses are illegal. The distrainer ought only to take sufficient
  to recover the rent due, and costs; if, however, the articles sell for
  a greater sum than is sufficient to pay these, the remainder must be
  returned to the tenant, who can demand a bill of the sale, and recover
  the overplus, if any.

<a name="p1523"></a><b><i>1523. &nbsp;Distress, Legal and Illegal</i></b><br>
<br>
  A distress can be made only for rent that is due, and cannot be made
  until the day after, nor unless it has been demanded by the landlord
  or his agent. The outer door must not be broken open for the purpose
  of distraining, neither can the distress be made between sun-setting
  and sun-rising, nor on Sunday, Good Friday, or Christmas-day; nor
  after the rent has been tendered to the landlord or his agent. A
  second distress can be made, if the value of the first is not enough
  to pay the real and costs, but not if, at the time of making the first
  distress, there were sufficient goods upon the premises to satisfy the
  full amount, if the landlord had then thought proper to take them.
  Wearing apparel and bedding of debtor and his family, and tools or
  implements of trade to the value of £5 are exempt from seizure, except
  where a tenant holds possession after term of tenancy or notice to
  quit has expired.

  resorted to by the landlord, it must be in the presence of a
  constable; but goods removed before the rent is actually due cannot be
  followed, but the rent can be recovered by action as a debt in the
  County Court. The general rule is, that nothing can be distrained

<a name="p1561"></a><b><i>1561. &nbsp;Breach of Promise of Marriage</i></b><br>
<br>
  Oral engagements and promises to marry will sustain an action, unless
  the marriage is limited to take place upwards of a year from the
  making of the contract, in which case the agreement to marry must be
  in writing.  No plaintiff can recover a verdict unless his or her
  testimony shall be corroborated by some other material evidence in
  support of the promise. The conduct of the suitor, subsequent to the
  breaking off the engagement, would weigh with the jury in estimating
  damages. An action may be commenced although the gentleman is not
  married.  The length of time which must elapse before action must be
  reasonable. A lapse of three years, or even half that time, without
  any attempt by the gentleman to renew the acquaintance, would lessen
  the damages very considerably&mdash;perhaps do away with all chance of
  success, unless the delay could be satisfactorily explained.<br>
<br>
  The mode of proceeding is by an action at law. For this an attorney
  must be retained, who will manage the whole affair to its termination.
  The first proceeding (the writ, service thereof, &amp;c.) costs from £2 to
  £5. The next proceeding&mdash;from a fortnight to a month after service of
  the writ&mdash;costs about £5 more. The whole costs, to the verdict of the
  jury, from £35 to £50, besides the expenses of the lady's witnesses.
  If the verdict be in her favour, the other side have to pay her costs,
  with the exception of about £10. If the verdict be against her, the
  same rule holds good, and she must pay her opponent's costs&mdash;probably
  from £60 to £70.

   <blockquote> "A man who was paying particular attentions to a young girl, was
    asked by the father of the latter, after one of his visits, what his
    intentions were, and he replied, 'I have pledged my honour to marry
    the girl in a month after Christmas'; and it was held that this
    declaration to the father, who had a right to make the inquiry, and
    to receive a true and correct answer, taken in connection with the
    visits to the house, and the conduct of the young people towards
    each other, was sufficient evidence of a promise of marriage."</blockquote>

    "The Common Law does not altogether discountenance long engagements
    to be married. If parties are young, and circumstances exist,
    showing that the period during which they had agreed to remain
    single was not unreasonably long, the contract is binding upon them;
    but if they are advanced in years, and the marriage is appointed to
    take place at a remote and unreasonably long period of time, the
    contract would be voidable, at the option of either of the parties,
    as being in restraint of matrimony. If no time is fixed and agreed
    upon for the performance of the contract, it is in contemplation of
    law <i>a contract to marry within a reasonable period after request.</i>"

    case of a refusal, or a neglect so to do on the part of the latter
    within a reasonable time after the request made, the party so
    calling upon the other for a fulfilment of the engagement may treat
    the betrothment as at end, and bring an action for damages for a
    breach of the engagement. If both parties lie by for an unreasonable
    period, and neither renew the contract from time to time by their
    conduct or actions, nor call upon one another to carry it into
    execution, the engagement will be deemed to be abandoned by mutual

<a name="p1584"></a><b><i>1584. &nbsp;To Search for Wills</i></b><br>
<br>
  If you wish to examine a will, your best course is to go to "The Wills
  Office," at Somerset House, Strand, have on a slip of paper the name
  of the testator&mdash;this, on entering, give to a clerk whom you will see
  at a desk on the right. At the same time pay a shilling, and you will
  then be entitled to search all the heavy Index volumes for the
  testator's name. The name found, the clerk will hand over the will for
  perusal, and there is no difficulty whatever, <i>provided you know about
  the year of the testator's death.</i> The Indexes are all arranged and
  numbered according to their years.<br>
<br>
  Not only the names of those who left wills are given, but also of
  those intestates to whose effects letters of administration have been
  granted. There is no charge beyond the shilling paid for entering. If
  you require a copy of the will, the clerk will calculate the expense,
  and you can have the copy in a few days. No questions whatever are
  asked&mdash;nor does the length of the will, or the time occupied in
  reading it, make any difference in the charge. Beyond the shilling
  paid on entering, there is no other demand whatever, unless for
  copying the whole or a portion of the will.<br>
<br>
  If the deceased at the time of his death had a fixed place of abode
  within the district of any of the District Registries attached to the
  Court of Probate, the will may now be proved, or letters of
  administration obtained from the district registrar. There are
  numerous district registries, viz., at Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol,
  York, Newcastle, Durham, and other places. If the will has not been
  proved in London, it will be found in the registry of the district in
  which the deceased dwelt at the time of his death. The same rules are
  observed in the country as in London, with regard to examination, &amp;c.
  The fee&mdash;one shilling&mdash;is the same in all. Having ascertained that the
  deceased left a will, and that it has been proved, the next inquiry
  is, <i>"Where was it proved?"</i> The above explanation and remarks apply
  also to the administrations granted to the effects of those who died
  without wills.

  If the Deceased leave a Widow, but no child or children, one half of

  divisible among the next of kin. The father of an intestate without
  children is entitled to one half of his estate, if he leave a widow,
  and to the whole if he leave no widow. When the nearest of kin are the
  mother and the brothers and sisters, the personal estate is divisible
  in equal portions, one of which will belong to the mother, and one to
  each of the brothers and sisters; and if there be children of a
  deceased brother or sister, an equal portion is divisible among each
  family of children.

<a name="p1619"></a><b><i>1619. &nbsp;Preserving Fruit</i></b><br>
<br>
  The grand secret of preserving is to deprive the fruit of its water of
  vegetation in the shortest time possible; for which purpose the fruit
  ought to be gathered just at the point of proper maturity. An
  ingenious French writer considers fruit of all kinds as having four
  distinct periods of maturity&mdash;the maturity of vegetation, of
  honeyfication, of expectation, and of coction.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1620"></a><b><i>1620. &nbsp;The First Period</i></b><br>
<br>
  The first period he considers to be that when, having gone through the
  vegetable processes up to the ripening, it appears ready to drop
  spontaneously. This, however, is a period which arrives sooner in the
  warm climate of France than in the colder orchards of England; but its
  absolute presence may be ascertained by the general filling out of the
  rind, by the bloom, by the smell, and by the facility with which it
  may be plucked from the branch. But even in France, as generally
  practised in England, this period may be hastened, either by cutting
  circularly through the outer rind at the foot of the branch, so as to
  prevent the return of the sap, or by bending the branch to a
  horizontal position on an espalier, which answers the same purpose.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1621"></a><b><i>1621. &nbsp;The Second Period</i></b><br>
<br>
  The second period, or that of Honeyfication, consists in the ripeness
  and flavour which fruits of all kinds acquire if plucked a few days
  before arriving at their first maturity, and preserved under a proper
  degree of temperature. Apples may acquire or arrive at this second
  degree of maturity upon the tree, but it too often happens that the
  flavour of the fruit is thus lost, for fruit over-ripe is always found
  to have parted with a portion of its flavour.
<br>

<a name="p1622"></a><b><i>1622. &nbsp;The Third Stage</i></b><br>
<br>
  The third stage, or of Expectation, as the theorist quaintly terms it,
  is that which is acquired by pulpy fruits, which, though sufficiently
  ripe to drop off the tree, are even then hard and sour. This is the
  case with several kinds both of apples and pears, not to mention other
  fruits, which always improve after keeping in the confectionery,&mdash;but
  with respect to the medlar and the quince, this maturity of
  expectation is absolutely necessary.

  The fourth degree of maturity, or of Coction, is completely
  artificial, and is nothing more nor less than the change produced upon
  fruit by the aid of culinary heat.

  the same principle to flowers or leaves which may be gathered for use.

<br>
The flowers ought to be gathered a day or two before the petals are
  ready to drop off spontaneously on the setting of the fruit: and the
  leaves must he plucked before the season has begun to rob them of
  their vegetable juices. The degree of heat necessary for the purpose
  of drying must next be considered, as it differs considerably with
  respect to different substances.

<br>
  Flowers or aromatic plants require the smallest increase of heat

  something more for rinds or roots, and a greater heat for fruits; but
  this heat must not be carried to excess.

<br>
It is not generally known that boiling fruit a long time, and
  <i>skimming it well, without sugar</i>, and <i>without a cover</i> to the
  preserving pan, is a very economical and excellent way&mdash;economical,
  because the bulk of the scum rises from the <i>fruit</i>, and not from the
  <i>sugar</i>; but the latter should be good. Boiling it without a <i>cover</i>
  allows the evaporation of all the watery particles therefrom, and
  renders the preserves firm and well flavoured. The proportions are,
  three quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Jam made in
  this way of currants, strawberries, raspberries, or gooseberries, is
  excellent. The sugar should be added after the skimming is completed.

<a name="p1629"></a><b><i>1629. &nbsp;To make a Syrup</i></b><br>
<br>
  Dissolve one pound of sugar in about a gill of water, boil for a few
  minutes, skimming it till quite clear. To every two pounds of sugar
  add the white of one egg well beaten. Boil very quickly, and skim
  carefully while boiling.

<br>
  White paper cut to a suitable size, dipped in brandy, and put over the
  preserves when cold, and then a double paper tied over the top. All
  preserves should stand a night before they are covered. Instead of
  brandy, the white of eggs may be used to glaze the paper covering, and
  the paper may be pasted round the edge of the pot instead of tied&mdash;it
  will exclude the air better.

<a name="p1631"></a><b><i>1631. &nbsp;To Bottle Fruits</i></b><br>
<br>
  Let the fruit to be preserved be quite dry, and without blemish. Take
  a bottle that is perfectly clean and dry within, and put in the fruit
  in layers, sprinkling sugar between each layer, put in the bung, and
  tie bladder over, setting the bottles, bung downwards, in a large
  stewpan of cold water, with hay between to prevent breaking. When the
  skin is just cracking, take them out. All preserves require exclusion
  from the air. Place a piece of paper dipped in sweet oil over the top
  of the fruit; prepare thin paper, immersed in gum-water, and while
  wet, press it over and around the top of the jar; as it dries, it will
  become quite firm and tight.

  juice, but leave the pulp in the lemons. Put them into a bowl with two

  tie it up, <i>quite hot</i>, with bladder, and set by till wanted. Taste
  the water the lemons are lying in at the end of the third day; if not
  bitter, lift the lemons out into a china-lined pan, pour the water
  through a strainer upon them, boil gently one or two hours; set by in
  a pan. Boil again next day, until so tender that the head of a large

<a name="p1642"></a><b><i>1642. &nbsp;To Preserve Eggs (1)</i></b><br>
<br>
  It has been long known to housewives, that the great secret of
  preserving eggs fresh is to place the small end downwards, and keep it
  in that position&mdash;other requisites not being neglected, such as to
  have the eggs perfectly fresh when deposited for keeping, not allowing
  them to become wet, keeping them cool in warm weather, and avoiding
  freezing in winter. Take an inch board of convenient size, say a foot
  wide, and two and a half feet long, and bore it full of holes, each
  about an inch and a half in diameter; a board of this size may have
  five dozen holes bored in it, for as many eggs. Then nail strips of
  thin board two inches wide round the edges to serve as a ledge. Boards
  such as this may now be made to constitute the shelves of a cupboard
  in a cool cellar. The only precaution necessary is to place the eggs
  as fast as they are laid in these holes, with the small end downwards,
  and they will keep for months perfectly fresh. The great advantage of
  this plan is the perfect ease with which the fresh eggs are packed
  away, and again obtained when wanted. A carpenter would make such a
  board for a trifling charge.

<br>
  Another Method.&mdash;The several modes recommended for preserving eggs any
  length of time are not always successful. The egg, to be preserved
  well, should be kept at a temperature so low that the air and fluids
  within its shell shall not be brought into a decomposing condition;
  and, at the same time, the air outside of its shell should be
  excluded, in order to prevent its action in any way upon the egg.

  The following mixture for preserving eggs was patented several years
  ago by Mr. Jayne, of Sheffield. He alleged that by means of it he
  could keep eggs two years. A part of his composition is often made use
  of&mdash;perhaps the whole of it would be better. Put into a tub or vessel
  one bushel of quicklime, two pounds of salt, half a pound of cream of
  tartar, and mix the same together, with as much water as will reduce
  the composition, or mixture, to that consistence that it will cause an
  egg put into it to swim with its top just above the liquid; then place
  the eggs therein.

<a name="p1656"></a><b><i>1656. &nbsp;Pickling</i></b><br>
<br>
  There are three methods of pickling; the most simple is merely to put
  the article into cold vinegar. The strongest pickling vinegar of white
  wine should always be used for pickles; and for white pickles, use
  distilled vinegar. This method may be recommended for all such
  vegetables as, being hot themselves, do not require the addition of
  spice, and such as do not require to be softened by heat, as capsicum,
  chili, nasturtiums, button-onions, radish-pods, horseradish, garlic,
  and shalots. Half fill the jars with best vinegar, fill them up with
  the vegetables, and tie down immediately with bladder and leather. 
  One advantage of this plan is that those who grow nasturtiums,
  radish-pods, and so forth, in their own gardens, may gather them from
  day to day, when they are exactly of the proper growth. They are very
  much better if pickled quite fresh, and all of a size, which can
  scarcely be obtained if they be pickled all at the same time. The
  onions should be dropped in the vinegar as fast as peeled; this
  secures their colour. The horseradish should be scraped a little
  outside, and cut up in rounds half an inch deep.

<a name="p1657"></a><b><i>1657. &nbsp;The Second Method of Pickling.</i></b><br>
<br>
  The second method of pickling is that of heating vinegar and spice,
  and pouring them hot over the vegetables to be pickled, which are
  previously prepared by sprinkling with salt, or immersing in brine. Do
  not boil the vinegar, for if so its strength will evaporate. Put the
  vinegar and spice into a jar, bung it down tightly, tie a bladder
  over, and let it stand on the hob or on a trivet by the side of the
  fire for three or four days; shake it well three or four times a day.
  This method may be applied to gherkins, French beans, cabbage,
  brocoli, cauliflowers, onions, and so forth.

<a name="p1658"></a><b><i>1658. &nbsp;The Third Method of Pickling</i></b><br>
<br>
  The third method of pickling is when the vegetables are in a greater
  or less degree done over the fire. Walnuts, artichokes, artichoke
  bottoms and beetroots are done thus, and sometimes onions and
  cauliflowers.

  into clean, dry jars, and cover them with hot pickle, in every quart
  of which has been steeped one ounce each of horseradish sliced, black
  pepper, allspice, and salt, with or without mustard seed. In all
  pickles the vinegar should always be two inches or more above the
  vegetables, as it is sure to shrink, and if the vegetables are not
  thoroughly immersed in pickle they will not keep.

  of the seed, and two or three cloves of garlic. The lid which encloses
  the spice may be sewed down or tied, by running a white thread through
  the cucumber and through the lid, then, after tying it together, cut
  off the ends. The pickle may be prepared with the spices directed for
  cucumbers, or with the following, which bears a nearer resemblance to

<a name="p1671"></a><b><i>1671. &nbsp;Indian Pickle</i></b><br>
<br>
  The vegetables to be employed for this favourite pickle are small hard
  knots of white cabbage, sliced; cauliflowers or brocoli in flakes;
  long carrots, not larger than a finger, or large carrots sliced (the
  former are far preferable); gherkins, French beans, small button
  onions, white turnip radishes half grown, radish-pods, shalots, young
  hard apples; green peaches, before the stones begin to form; vegetable
  marrow, not larger than a hen's egg; small green melons, celery,
  shoots of green elder, horseradish, nasturtiums, capsicums, and
  garlic.<br>
<br>
  As all these vegetables do not come in season together, the best
  method is to prepare a large jar of pickle at such time of the year as
  most of the things may be obtained, and add the others as they come in
  season. Thus the pickle will be nearly a year in making, and ought to
  stand another year before using, when, if properly managed, it will be
  excellent, but it will keep and continue to improve for years.<br>
<br>
  For preparing the several vegetables, the same directions may be
  observed as for pickling them separately, only following this general
  rule&mdash;that, if possible, boiling is to be avoided, and soaking in
  brine to be preferred. Be very particular that every ingredient is
  perfectly dry before it is put into the jar, and that the jar is very
  closely tied down every time that it is opened for the addition of
  fresh vegetables. Neither mushrooms, walnuts, nor red cabbage are to
  be admitted.<br>
<br>
  <i>For the pickle:</i>&mdash;To a gallon of the best white wine vinegar add salt
  three ounces, flour of mustard half a pound, turmeric two ounces,
  white ginger sliced three ounces, cloves one ounce, mace, black
  pepper, long pepper, white pepper, half an ounce each, cayenne two
  drachms, shalots peeled four ounces, garlic peeled two ounces; steep
  the spice in vinegar on the hob or trivet for two or three days. The
  mustard and turmeric must be rubbed smooth with a little cold vinegar,
  and stirred into the rest when as near boiling as possible. Such
  vegetables as are ready may be put in; when cayenne, nasturtiums, or
  any other vegetables mentioned in the first method of pickling (<i>par</i>.
  <a href="#p1656">1656</a>) come in season, put them in the pickle as they are; for the
  preparation of vegetables mentioned in the second method (<i>par</i>.
  <a href="#p1657">1657</a>), use a small quantity of hot vinegar without spice; when cold,
  pour it off, and put the vegetables into the general jar.<br>
<br>
  If the vegetables are greened in vinegar, as French beans and
  gherkins, this will not be so necessary, but the adoption of this
  process will tend to improve all. Onions had better not be wetted at
  all; but if it be desirous not to have the full flavour, both onions,
  shalots, and garlic may be sprinkled with salt in a cullender, to draw
  off all the strong juice; let them lie two or three hours. The elder,
  apples, peaches, and so forth, should be greened as gherkins. The
  roots, radishes, carrots, celery, are only soaked in brine and dried.
  Half a pint of salad oil is sometimes added. It should be rubbed up in
  a bowl with the flour of mustard and turmeric.&mdash;It is not essential to
  Indian pickle to have every variety of vegetable here mentioned; but
  all these are admissible, and the greater the variety the more the
  pickle is approved.

<br>
  Do not keep pickles in common earthenware, as the glazing contains
  lead, and combines with the vinegar. Vinegar for pickling should be
  sharp, though not the sharpest kind, as it injures the pickles. If you
  use copper, bell-metal, or brass vessels for pickling, never allow the
  vinegar to cool in them, as it then is poisonous. Vinegar may be
  prepared ready for use for any kind of pickling by adding a
  teaspoonful of alum and a teacupful of salt to three gallons of
  vinegar, with a bag containing pepper, ginger root, and all the
  different spices that are used in pickling. Keep pickles only in wood
  or stone ware. Anything that has held grease will spoil pickles. Stir
  pickles occasionally, and if there are soft ones take them out, and
  scald the vinegar, and pour it hot over the pickles. Keep enough
  vinegar in every jar to cover the pickles completely. If it is weak,
  take fresh vinegar and pour on hot. Do not boil vinegar or spice above
  five minutes.

<a name="p1710"></a><b><i>1710. &nbsp;Superfluous Hair</i></b><br>
<br>
Any remedy is doubtful; many of those commonly used are dangerous. The
  safest plan is as follows:&mdash;The hairs should be perseveringly plucked
  up by the roots, and the skin, having been washed twice a day with
  warm soft water, without soap, should be treated with the following
  wash, commonly called <b>Milk of Roses</b>:<br>
<br>
  Beat four ounces of sweet almonds in a mortar, and add half an ounce
  of white sugar during the process; reduce the whole to a paste by
  pounding; then add, in small quantities at a time, eight ounces of
  rose water. The emulsion thus formed should be strained through a fine
  cloth, and the residue again pounded, while the strained fluid should
  be bottled in a large stoppered vial. To the pasty mass in the mortar
  add half an ounce of sugar, and eight ounces of rose water, and strain
  again. This process must be repeated three times.<br>
<br>
  To the thirty-two ounces of fluid, add twenty grains of the bichloride
  of mercury, dissolved in two ounces of alcohol, and shake the mixture
  for five minutes. The fluid should be applied with a towel,
  immediately after washing, and the skin gently rubbed with a dry
  cloth, till <i>perfectly</i> dry. Wilson, in his work on <i>Healthy Skin</i>,
  writes as follows:

    <blockquote>"Substances are sold by the perfumers called depilatories, which are
    represented as having the power of removing hair. But the hair is
    not destroyed by these means, the root and that part of the shaft
    implanted within the skin still remain, and are ready to shoot up
    with increased vigour as soon as the depilatory is withdrawn. The
    effect of the depilatory is the same, in this respect, as that of a
    razor, and the latter is, unquestionably, the better remedy. It must
    not, however, be imagined that depilatories are negative remedies,
    and that, if they do no permanent good, they are, at least,
    harmless; that is not the fact; they are violent irritants, and
    require to be used with the utmost caution."</blockquote>

<a name="p1711"></a><b><i>1711. &nbsp;To Clean Hair Brushes</i></b><br>
<br>
  As hot water and soap very soon soften the hair, and rubbing completes
  its destruction, use soda, dissolved in cold water, instead; soda
  having an affinity for grease, it cleans the brush with little
  friction. Do not set them near the fire, nor in the sun, to dry, but
  after shaking well, set them on the point of the handle in a shady
  place.

<br>
  If to preserve health be to save medical expenses, without even
  reckoning upon time and comfort, there is no part of the household
  arrangement so important as cheap convenience for personal ablution.
  For this purpose baths upon a large and expensive scale are by no
  means necessary; but though temporary or tin baths may be extremely
  useful upon pressing occasions, it will be found to be finally as
  cheap, and much more readily convenient, to have a permanent bath
  constructed, which may be done in any dwelling-house of moderate size,
  without interfering with other general purposes. There is no necessity
  to notice the salubrious effects resulting from the bath, beyond the
  two points of its being so conducive to both health and cleanliness,
  in keeping up a free circulation of the blood, without any violent
  muscular exertion, thereby really affording a saving of strength, and
  producing its effects without any expense either to the body or to the
  purse.

  appear a simple suggestion, but experience only will show how much
  time might be redeemed by habits of regularity: such as putting the
  shawls, cloaks, gloves, shoes, clogs, &amp;c., &amp;c., or whatever is
  intended to be worn, in readiness, instead of having to search one
  drawer, then another, for possibly a glove or collar&mdash;wait for shoes
  being cleaned, &amp;c.&mdash;and this when (probably) the outgoing persons have
  to return to their employment at a given time. Whereas, if all were in

<br>
  In the forenoon, when the stomach is not too much distended, muscular

<br>
  To walk gracefully, the body must be erect, but not stiff, and the
  head held up in such a posture that the eyes are directed forward. The
  tendency of untaught walkers is to look towards the ground near the
  feet; and some persons appear always as if admiring their shoe-ties.
  The eyes should not thus be cast downward, neither should the chest
  bend forward to throw out the back, making what are termed round
  shoulders; on the contrary, the body should be held erect, as if the
  person to whom it belongs were not afraid to look the world in the
  face, and the chest by all means be allowed to expand. At the same
  time, everything like strutting or pomposity must be carefully
  avoided. An easy, firm, and erect posture is alone desirable. In
  walking, it is necessary to bear in mind that the locomotion is to be
  performed entirely by the legs. Awkward persons rock from side to
  side, helping forward each leg alternately by advancing the haunches.
  This is not only ungraceful but fatiguing. Let the legs alone advance,
  bearing up the body.

It has been asserted, and we believe with some truth, that singing is

  Rush, an eminent physician, observes on this subject:

    <blockquote>"The Germans are seldom afflicted with consumption; and this, I
    believe, is in part occasioned by the strength which their lungs
    acquire by exercising them in vocal music, for this constitutes an
    essential branch of their education. The music master of an academy
    has furnished me with a remark still more in favour of this opinion.
    He informed me that he had known several instances of persons who
    were strongly disposed to consumption, who were restored to health
    by the exercise of their lungs in singing."</blockquote>

  In dry, sultry weather the heat ought to be counteracted by means of a

  subservient. We ought to give the preference to such alimentary
  substances as lead to contract the juices which are too much expanded
  by the heat, and this property is possessed by all acid food and
  drink. To this class belong all sorts of salad, lemons, oranges,
  pomegranates sliced and sprinkled with sugar, for the acid of this
  fruit is not so apt to derange the stomach as that of lemons; also
  cherries and strawberries, curds turned with lemon acid or cream of
  tartar; cream of tartar dissolved in water; lemonade, and Rhenish or

<br>
  How to get sleep is to many persons a matter of high importance.
  Nervous persons who are troubled with wakefulness and excitability,
  usually have a strong tendency of blood on the brain, with cold
  extremities. The pressure of the blood on the brain keeps it in a
  stimulated or wakeful state, and the pulsations in the head are often
  painful. Let such rise and chafe the body and extremities with a brush
  or towel, or rub smartly with the hands, to promote circulation, and
  withdraw the excessive amount of blood from the brain, and they will
  fall asleep in a few moments. A cold bath, or a sponge bath and
  rubbing, or a good run, or a rapid walk in the open air, or going up
  and down stairs a few times just before retiring, will aid in
  equalizing circulation and promoting sleep. These rules are simple,
  and easy of application in all cases.

   <blockquote> "Although it is of consequence to the debilitated to go early to
    bed, there are few things more hurtful to them than remaining in it
    too long. Getting up an hour or two earlier often gives a degree of
    vigour which nothing else can procure. For those who are not much
    debilitated, and sleep well, the best rule is to get out of bed soon
    after waking in the morning. This at first may appear too early, for
    the debilitated require more sleep than the healthy; but rising
    early will gradually prolong the sleep on the succeeding night, till
    the quantity the patient enjoys is equal to his demand for it. Lying
    late is not only hurtful, by the relaxation it occasions, but also
    by occupying that part of the day at which exercise is most
    beneficial."</blockquote>

  of a regular plan, by means of which he is said to have reached the
  great age of 140 years, without having ever experienced disease. His
  advice to the readers of his "Treatise on Health" is as follows:
  
    <blockquote>"I beseech all persons who shall read this work not to degrade
    themselves to a level with the brutes, or the rabble, by gratifying
    their sloth, or by eating and drinking promiscuously whatever
    pleases their palates, or by indulging their appetites of every
    kind. But whether they understand physic or not, let them consult
    their reason, and observe what agrees, and what does not agree with
    them, that, like wise men, they may adhere to the use of such things
    as conduce to their health, and forbear everything which, by their
    own experience, they find to do them hurt; and let them be assured

  Late hours, irregular habits, and want of attention to diet, are
  common errors with most young men, and these gradually, but at first
  imperceptibly, undermine the health, and lay the foundation for
  various forms of disease in after life. It is a very difficult thing
  to make young persons comprehend this. They frequently sit up as late
  as twelve, one, or two o'clock, without experiencing any ill effects;
  they go without a meal to day, and to-morrow eat to repletion, with
  only temporary inconvenience. One night they will sleep three or four
  hours, and the next nine or ten; or one night, in their eagerness to
  get away into some agreeable company, they will take no food at all,
  and the next, perhaps, will eat a hearty supper, and go to bed upon
  it. These, with various other irregularities, are common to the
  majority of young men, and are, as just stated, the cause of much bad
  health in mature life. Indeed, nearly all the shattered constitutions
  with which too many are cursed, are the result of a disregard to the
  plainest precepts of health in early life.

  Numerous experiments with roasted coffee prove that it is the most
  powerful means, not only of rendering animal and vegetable effluvia
  innocuous, but of actually destroying them. A room in which meat in an
  advanced degree of decomposition had been kept for some time, was
  instantly deprived of all smell on an open coffee-roaster being
  carried through it, containing a pound of coffee newly roasted. In
  another room, exposed to the effluvium occasioned by the clearing out
  of the dung-pit, so that sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia in great
  quantities could be chemically detected, the stench was completely
  removed in half a minute, on the employment of three ounces of
  fresh-roasted coffee, whilst the other parts of the house were
  permanently cleared of the same smell by being simply traversed with
  the coffee-roaster, although the cleansing of the dung-pit continued
  for several hours after.<br>
<br>
  The best mode of using the coffee as a disinfectant is to dry the raw
  bean, pound it in a mortar, and then roast the powder on a moderately
  heated iron plate, until it assumes a dark brown tint, when it is fit
  for use. Then sprinkle it in sinks or cess-pools, or lay it on a plate
  in the room which you wish to have purified. Coffee acid or coffee oil

  The great efficacy of wood and animal charcoal in absorbing effluvia,

  Charcoal powder has also, during many centuries, been advantageously
  employed as a filter for putrid water, the object in view being to
  deprive the water of numerous organic impurities diffused through it,
  which exert injurious effects on the animal economy. Charcoal not only
  absorbs effluvia and gaseous bodies, but especially, when in contact
  with atmospheric air, oxidize, and destroys many of the easily
  alterable ones, by resolving them into the simplest combinations they
  are capable of forming, which are chiefly water and carbonic acid. It
  is on this oxidizing property of charcoal, as well as on its absorbent
  power, that its efficacy as a deodorizing and disinfecting agent
  chiefly depends.

  the close wards of hospitals, and in the impure atmospheres of many of
  the back courts and mews-lanes of large cities, all the impurities
  being absorbed and retained by the charcoal, while a current of pure

  to the sinks in private dwellings, the foul water in both cases being
  carried into the drain by means of tolerably wide syphon pipes,
  retaining always about a couple of inches of water. Such an
  arrangement would effectually prevent the escape of any effluvia,
  would be easy of construction, and not likely to get soon out of
  order.<br>
<br>
  In respirators for the mouth the air is made to pass through a quarter
  of an inch of coarsely powdered charcoal, retained in its place by two
  sheets of silvered wire gauze, covered over with thin woollen cloth,
  by which means its temperature is greatly increased. The charcoal
  respirator possesses a decided advantage over respirators of the
  ordinary construction, in that all disagreeable effluvia are absorbed
  by the charcoal, so that comparatively pure air is alone inhaled.
  Adaptations may be made to cover the nostrils as well as the mouth,
  for protecting the wearer against fevers and other infectious
  diseases, and chiefly for use in chemical works, common sewers, &amp;c.,
  to protect the workmen from the noxious effects of the deleterious
  gases to which they are frequently exposed.

<br>
  Charcoal powder has been most successfully employed at hospitals, to
  arrest the progress of gangrene and other putrid sores. The charcoal
  does not require to be put immediately in contact with the sores, but
  is placed above the dressings, not unfrequently quilted loosely in a
  little cotton wool. In many cases patients who were rapidly sinking
  have been restored to health.

<br>
  Any room, however offensive it may be, can be perfectively deodorized
  by means of a few trays filled with a thin layer of freshly-heated
  wood charcoal.  From these and other considerations it is evident that
  charcoal is one of the cheapest and best disinfectants. Unlike many
  other disinfectants, it evolves no disagreeable vapours, and if heated
  in close vessels will always act, however long it has been in use,
  quite as effectively as at first. The efficiency of the charcoal may
  be greatly increased by making it red-hot before using it. This can
  easily be done by heating it in an iron saucepan covered with an iron
  lid. When the charcoal is to be applied to inflammable substances,
  such as wooden floors, &amp;c., of course it must be allowed to cool in
  close vessels before being used.

  Of late years new disinfectants for the removal of disagreeable and

  into use. Sir William Burnett's disinfecting fluid is too well known
  to require description. It is invaluable in a sick room, and is sold

  whence the smell proceeds. A little dissolved in a bucket of water,
  when used in scrubbing rooms and passages, will purify them and render

  storage, as many lives have been lost through taking carbolic acid
  under the impression that it was some medicine or beverage. It is far
  safer when in the form of powder which has been impregnated with the

<i>Why is the flesh of sheep that are fed near the sea more nutritious

<br>
    Because the saline particles (sea salt) which they find with their

<br>
    <i>Why does the marbled appearance of fat in meat indicate that it is
    young and tender?</i><br>
<br>
    Because in young animals fat is dispersed through the muscles, but
    in old animals it is laid in masses on the outside of the flesh.

<br>
    <i>Why is some flesh white and other flesh red?</i><br>
<br>
    White flesh contains a larger proportion of albumen, (similar to the
    white of egg) than that which is red. The amount of blood retained
    in the flesh also influences its colour.

<br>
    <i>Why are raw oysters more wholesome than those that are cooked?</i><br>
<br>
    When cooked they are partly deprived of salt water, which promotes
    their digestion; their albumen also becomes hard (like hard boiled
    eggs).

    <i>Why have some oysters a green tinge?</i><br>
<br>
    This has been erroneously attributed to the effects of copper; but
    it arises from the oyster feeding upon small green sea-weeds, which
    grow where such oysters are found.

<br>
    <i>Why is cabbage rendered more wholesome by being boiled in two
    waters?</i><br>
<br>
    Because cabbages contain an oil, which is apt to produce bad
    effects, and prevents some persons from eating "green" vegetables.
    When boiled in two waters, the first boiling carries off the greater
    part of this oil.

<br>
    <i>Why should horseradish be scraped for the table only just before it
    is required?</i><br>
<br>
    Because the peculiar oil of horseradish is very volatile; it quickly
    evaporates, and leaves the vegetable substance dry and insipid.

    The properties of mint are stomachic and antispasmodic. It is

    especially from soups made of green or dried peas.

<br>
    <i>Why is apple sauce eaten with pork and goose?</i><br>
<br>
    Because it is slightly laxative, and therefore tends to counteract
    the effects of rich and stimulating meats. The acid of the apples
    also neutralizes the oily nature of the fat, and prevents
    biliousness.

<br>
    <i>Why does milk turn sour during thunderstorms?</i><br>
<br>
    Because, in an electric condition of the atmosphere, ozone is
    generated. Ozone is oxygen in a state of great intensity; and oxygen
    is a general acidifier of many organic substances. Milk may be
    prevented from becoming sour by boiling it, or bringing it nearly to
    boiling point, for, as the old proverb says, "Milk boiled is milk
    spoiled." Heating the milk expels the oxygen.

<br>
    <i>Why does the churning of cream or milk produce butter?</i><br>
<br>
    Because the action of stirring, together with a moderate degree of
    warmth, causes the cells in which the butter is confined to burst;
    the disengaged fat collects in flakes, and ultimately coheres in
    large masses.

<br>
    <i>Why are some of the limbs of birds more tender than others?</i><br>
<br>
    The tenderness or toughness of flesh is determined by the amount of
    exercise the muscles have undergone. Hence the wing of a bird that
    chiefly walks, and the leg of a bird that chiefly flies, are the
    most tender.

    <i>Why is loose clothing warmer than tight articles of dress?</i><br>
<br>
    Because the loose dress encloses a stratum of warm air which the

    not warmer in themselves, appear so, by keeping warm air near to the
    body.
