<br>
  Although there is a continual change in designs and materials for
  fancy needlework of every description, the fundamental principles on
  which this kind of work in all its various branches is executed remain
  the same. These are carefully, though briefly set forth in the
  following series of instructions on this subject.

<a name="p1810"></a><b><i>1810. &nbsp;Popularity of Crochet</i></b><br>
<br>
  Perhaps no kind of work has ever attained such popularity as
  <i>Crochet</i>. Whether as a simple trimming, as an elaborate quilt, or as
  a fabric, almost rivalling Point Lace, it is popular with every woman
  who has any time at all for fancy work, since it is only needful to
  understand the stitches, and the terms and contractions used in
  writing the descriptions of the different designs, to be enabled to
  work with ease the most beautiful pattern that ever appeared in
  crochet.

<a name="p1812"></a><b><i>1812. &nbsp;Chain Stitch, ch.</i></b><br>
<br>
  Hook the cotton into a loop, and keep on looping the cotton through a
  previous stitch till a succession of chains are made to form a
  foundation.

<a name="p1813"></a><b><i>1813. &nbsp;Single Crochet, s.</i></b><br>
<br>
  This occurs only in working designs; the hook is inserted in a stitch,
  and the cotton is pulled through that and the cotton which is on the
  hook at the same time; it thus makes a close tie.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1814"></a><b><i>1814. &nbsp;Double Crochet, or dc.</i></b><br>
<br>
  With cotton on the hook insert the latter into a stitch, draw the
  cotton through; there are now two loops on the hook, take up the
  cotton on the hook, and with cotton again upon the hook draw it
  through the two loops.
<br>

<a name="p1815"></a><b><i>1815. &nbsp;Long Stitch, or l.</i></b><br>
<br>
  With the loop of last stitch on the hook, twist the cotton over the
  hook, place the latter through a stitch, draw the cotton through, then
  put the cotton over the hook, draw the cotton through two loops, and
  again through two loops.

<a name="p1816"></a><b><i>1816. &nbsp;Double and Treble Long</i></b><br>
<br>
  With the hook in a loop, twist the cotton twice or three times over
  the hook, and draw the hook successively through either two or three
  loops.

<a name="p1817"></a><b><i>1817. &nbsp;Square Crochet</i></b><br>
<br>
  Square crochet is also sometimes used.  The squares are either open or
  close. An open square consists of one L, two Ch, missing two on the
  line beneath, before making the next stitch. A close square has three
  successive L's. Thus, any given number of close squares, followed by
  an open, will have so many times three L's; consequently any
  foundation for square crochet must have a number that can be divided
  by three.

<a name="p1818"></a><b><i>1818. &nbsp;To Contract an Edge</i></b><br>
<br>
  This may be done in Dc, or long stitch. Twist the thread round the
  hook as often as required, insert it in the work, and half do a
  stitch.  Instead of finishing it, twist the thread round again, until
  the same number of loops are on, and work a stitch entirely; so that,
  for two stitches, there is only one head.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1819"></a><b><i>1819. &nbsp;To Join on a Thread</i></b><br>
<br>
  Joins should be avoided as much as possible in open work. In joining,
  finish the stitch by drawing the new thread through, leaving two
  inches for both ends, which must be held in.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1820"></a><b><i>1820. &nbsp;To Use Several Colours</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is done in single crochet.  Hold the threads not in use on the
  edge of the work, and work them in. Change the colour by beginning the
  stitch in the old colour, and finishing it with the new, continuing
  the work with the latter holding in the old.  If only one stitch is
  wanted in the new colour, finish one stitch, and begin the next with
  it; then change.
<br>

<a name="p1821"></a><b><i>1821. &nbsp;To Join Leaves, &amp;c.</i></b><br>
<br>
  When one part of a leaf or flower is required to be joined to another,
  drop the loop from the hook, which insert in the place to be joined;
  draw the loop through and continue.
<br>

<a name="p1822"></a><b><i>1822. &nbsp;To Work over Cord</i></b><br>
<br>
  Hold the cord in the left hand with the work, and work round it, as
  you would over an end of thread, working closely. When beads are used
  they must be first threaded on silk or thread, and then dropped,
  according to the pattern, on the <i>wrong</i> side of the work. This side
  looks more even than the other: therefore, when bead purses are worked
  from an engraving, they are worked the reverse of the usual way, viz.,
  from right to left.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1823"></a><b><i>1823. &nbsp;Oriental Crochet erroneously termed Tricotee</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is worked by just making a chain the length required. Then put
  the hook through a loop of the chain, pull the wool through without
  twisting it, and so continue to the end, keeping all the stitches on
  the hook. <i>In returning</i>, twist the wool over the hook, pull it
  through the first loop, twist the wool again over the hook, pull it
  through the next, and so continue to the end. There will now be a row
  of flat loops, but not on the edge. Work exactly as at the first row
  which was worked with the chain row, but in this there is no chain row.

<hr width="25%" align="left">

<a name="p1825"></a><b><i>1825. &nbsp;Regularity in Netting</i></b><br>
<br>
  The beauty of netting consists in its firmness and regularity. All
  joins in the thread must be made in a very strong knot; and, if
  possible, at an edge, so that it may not be perceived.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1826"></a><b><i>1826. &nbsp;Implements used in Netting</i></b><br>
<br>
  These are a netting needle and mesh. In filling a netting needle with
  the material, be careful not to make it so full that there will be a
  difficulty in passing it through the stitches. The size of the needle
  must depend on the material to be employed, and the fineness of the
  work. Steel needles are employed for every kind of netting except the
  very coarsest.  They are marked from 12 to 24, the latter being
  extremely fine.  The fine meshes are usually also of steel; but, as
  this material is heavy, it is better to employ bone or wooden meshes
  when large ones are required. Many meshes are flat; and in using them
  the <i>width</i> is given.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1827"></a><b><i>1827. &nbsp;Diamond Netting</i></b><br>
<br>
  The first stitch in this work is termed <i>diamond</i> netting, the holes
  being in the form of diamonds. To do the first row, a stout thread,
  knotted to form a round, is fastened to the knee with a pin, or passed
  over the foot, or on the hook sometimes attached to a work cushion for
  the purpose. The end of the thread on the needle is knotted to this,
  the mesh being held in the left hand on a line with it. Take the
  needle in the right hand; let the thread come over the mesh and the
  third finger, bring it back under the mesh, and hold it between the
  thumb and first finger. Slip the needle through the loop over the
  third finger, under the mesh and the foundation thread. In doing this
  a loop will be formed, which must be passed over the fourth finger.
  Withdraw the third finger from the loop, and draw up the loop over the
  fourth, gradually, until it is quite tight on the mesh. The thumb
  should be kept firmly over the mesh while the stitch is being
  completed. When the necessary number of stitches is made on this
  foundation, the future rows are to be worked backwards and forwards.
  To form a <i>round</i>, the first stitch is to be worked into immediately
  after the last, which closes the netting into a circle.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1828"></a><b><i>1828. &nbsp;Round Netting </i></b><br>
<br>
  Round Netting is very nearly the same stitch. The difference is merely
  in the way of putting the needle through the loop and foundation, or
  other stitch. After passing the needle through the loop, it must be
  brought out,  and put <i>downwards</i> through the stitch.  This stitch is
  particularly suitable for purses.
<br>

<a name="p1829"></a><b><i>1829. &nbsp;Square Netting</i></b><br>
<br>
  Square Netting is exactly the same stitch as diamond netting, only it
  is begun at a corner, on one stitch, and increased (by doing two in
  one) in the last stitch of every row, until the greatest width
  required is attained. Then, by netting two stitches together at the
  end of every row, the piece is decreased to a point again. When
  stretched out, all the holes in this netting are squares.

<a name="p1830"></a><b><i>1830. &nbsp;Darning on Netting</i></b><br>
<br>
  Square and diamond netting are the most frequently used, and are
  ornamented with patterns darned on them, in simple darning or in
  various point stitches. In the latter case it forms a variety of the
  sort of work termed <i>guipure d'Art</i>.

    Do one plain row. First pattern row. Insert the needle in the
    first stitch, and, without working it, draw through it the second
    stitch, through the loop of which draw the first, and work it in the
    ordinary way. This forms a twisted stitch, and the next is a very
    small loop formed of a part of the second stitch. Repeat this

<a name="p1833"></a><b><i>1833. &nbsp;Instructions in Tatting, or Frivolité</i></b><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">

<a name="p1834"></a><b><i>1834. &nbsp;Implements for Tatting</i></b><br>
<br>
  The only necessary implements for tatting are a thin shuttle or short
  netting-needle, and a gilt pin and ring, united by a chain. The cotton
  used should be strong and soft. There are three available sizes, Nos.
  1, 2, and 3. Attention should be paid to the manner of holding the
  hands, as on this depends the grace or awkwardness of the movement.
  Fill the shuttle with the cotton (or silk) required, in the same
  manner as a netting needle. Hold the shuttle between the thumb and
  first and second fingers of the right hand, leaving about half a yard
  of cotton unwound. Take up the cotton, about three inches from the
  end, between the thumb and first finger of the left hand, and let the
  end fall in the palm of the hand; pass the cotton round the other
  fingers of the left hand (keeping them parted a little), and bring it
  again between the thumb and forefinger, thus making a circle round the
  extended fingers. There are only two stitches in tatting, and they are
  usually done alternately; this is therefore termed a <i>double stitch</i>.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1835"></a><b><i>1835. &nbsp;English Stitch</i></b><br>
<br>
  The first stitch is called the <i>English stitch</i>, and made thus:&mdash;Let
  the thread between the right and left hands fall towards you; slip the
  shuttle under the thread between the first and second fingers; draw it
  out rather quickly, keeping it in a horizontal line with the left
  hand. You will find a slipping loop is formed on this cotton with that
  which went round the fingers. Hold the shuttle steadily, with the
  cotton stretched tightly out, and with the second finger of the left
  hand slip the loop thus made under the thumb.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1836"></a><b><i>1836. &nbsp;French Stitch</i></b><br>
<br>
  The other stitch is termed <i>French stitch</i>; the only difference being,
  that instead of allowing the cotton to fall <i>towards</i> you, and passing
  the shuttle <i>downwards</i>, the cotton is thrown in a loop over the left
  hand, and the shuttle passed under the thread between the first and
  second fingers <i>upwards</i>. The knot must be invariably formed by the
  thread which passes round the fingers of the <i>left</i> hand. If the
  operation is reversed, and the knot formed by the cotton connected
  with the shuttle, the loop will not draw up. This is occasioned by
  letting the cotton from the shuttle hang loosely instead of drawing it
  out and holding it tightly stretched. When any given number of these
  double stitches are done, and drawn closely together, the stitches are
  held between the first finger and thumb, and the other fingers are
  withdrawn from the circle of cotton, which is gradually diminished by
  drawing out the shuttle until the loop of tatting is nearly or
  entirely closed. The tatted loops should be quite close to each other,
  unless directions to the contrary are given.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1837"></a><b><i>1837. &nbsp;Ornamental Edging</i></b><br>
<br>
  The pin is used in making an ornamental edge, something like purl
  edging, thus:&mdash;Slip the ring on the left-hand thumb, that the pin
  attached may be ready for use. After making the required number of
  double stitches, twist the pin in the circle of cotton, and hold it
  between the forefinger and thumb, whilst making more double stitches;
  repeat. The little loops thus formed are termed <i>picots</i>.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1838"></a><b><i>1838. &nbsp;Trefoil Tatting</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is done by drawing three loops up tightly, made close together,
  and then leaving a short space before making more. The trefoil is
  sewed into shape afterwards with a needle.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p1839"></a><b><i>1839. &nbsp;To Join Loops</i></b><br>
<br>
  When two loops are to be connected, a <i>picot</i> is made in the <i>first</i>,
  wherever the join is required.  When you come to the corresponding
  part of the <i>second</i> loop, draw the thread which goes round the
  fingers of the left hand through the <i>picot</i> with a needle, pulling
  through a loop large enough to admit the shuttle. Slip this through,
  then draw the thread tight again over the fingers, and continue the
  work. In many patterns a needle is used to work over, in buttonhole
  stitch, the thread which passes from one loop to another.  A long
  needleful of the same cotton or silk used for the tatting is left at
  the beginning of the work, and a common needle used to buttonhole over
  bars wherever they occur.

<a name="p1842"></a><b><i>1842. &nbsp;Improvements in Process</i></b><br>
<br>
  Although the art of knitting is known perhaps more generally than
  almost any other kind of fancy work, still as the knowledge is not
  universal, and there have been of late years great improvements in
  many of the processes, we hope that a short account of all the
  stitches, and the elementary parts of the craft, will be welcomed by
  many of our friends&mdash;and most seriously would we recommend them to
  attain <i>perfection</i> in this branch of work, because, above all others,
  it is a resource to those who, from weak eyes, are precluded from many
  kinds of industrial amusement, or who, as invalids, cannot bear the
  fatigue of more elaborate work. The fact is that knitting does not
  require eyesight at all; and a very little practice ought to enable
  any one to knit whilst reading, talking, or studying, quite as well as
  if the fingers were unemployed. It only requires that the fingers
  should be properly used, and that one should not be made to do the
  duty of another.

  These are rods or pins of ivory, bone, or steel. The latter are most
  commonly used, and should have tapered points, without the least

<br>
  The first process in knitting is casting on. To effect this, hold the
  end of cotton between the first and second fingers of the left hand;
  bring it over the thumb and forefinger, and bend the latter to twist
  the cotton into a loop; bend the needle in the loop; hold the cotton
  attached to the reel between the third and little fingers of the right
  hand, and over the point of the forefinger; bring the thread round the
  needle by the slightest possible motion; bend the needle towards you,
  and tighten the loop on the left-hand finger, in letting it slip off
  to form the <i>first</i> stitch.

  Now take that needle with the loop on it in the left hand, and another
  in the right. Observe the position of the hands. The left hand needle
  is held between the thumb and the second finger, leaving the
  forefinger free, to aid in moving the points of the needles. This mode
  of using the forefinger, instead of employing it merely to hold the
  needle, is the great secret of being able to knit without looking at
  the work, for so extremely delicate is the sense of touch in this
  finger, that it will, after a little practice, enable you to tell the
  sort of stitch coming next, in the finest material, so that knitting
  becomes merely mechanical. Insert the point in the loop, bringing it
  behind the other needle, slip the thread round it, bring the point in
  front, and transfer the loop to the left-hand needle without
  withdrawing it from the right hand. Repeat the process for any number
  of stitches required.

  Embroidery, properly speaking, includes every sort of ornamental work
  done with a sewing needle of any kind; but in its popular acceptation,
  it applies only to the ornamentation of any article by the eye, or
  from drawn or marked patterns&mdash;whatever may be the material, or
  combination of materials employed; Berlin or canvas work, on the
  contrary, is the usual designation of all kinds of embroidery on
  canvas, <i>done by counting threads</i>, and frequently by the aid of a
  painting on checked paper.

<br>
  Although these two different sorts of work are really equally entitled

  and confine our present remarks to that sort of embroidery which is

<br>
  Every sort of embroidery material may be used for embroidering upon.
  The most common are muslin, cambric, velvet, satin, cloth, and leather.

<br>
  The simplest style of embroidery is that termed <i>Application</i>,&mdash;that
  is, where the pattern is in one material, laid on another which forms
  the ground. In this way muslin is worked on net, velvet is laid on
  cloth, or on another velvet, and cretonne designs cut out and laid on
  another material, the edges being either sewed over, or ornamented
  with fancy cord, braid, gold thread, or any other appropriate material.

  Another very easy style of ornamentation is that known as braiding.
  Children's dresses are worked with narrow silk or worsted braid, the
  latter being also used for ladies' aprons, flounces, &amp;c. Gold and
  silver braid enter largely into various sorts of decorated needlework,
  and the Victoria braid, of cotton, which has something of the
  appearance of satin stitch, is generally known.

<br>
  White embroidery, or embroidery on muslin, is used for a great variety
  of articles of ladies' dress. The simplest is termed Broderie
  Anglaise. In this style, the pattern is either in satin stitch, or
  from left to right, formed of holes cut out of the muslin, and sewed
  over with embroidery cotton. The great art in working broderie is to
  make the holes all of the same size, and to take the stitches closely
  and regular.

<a name="p1866"></a><b><i>1866. &nbsp;Satin Stitch</i></b><br>
<br>
  Satin stitch is a smooth raised work, used for leaves, flowers, &amp;c. It
  is done by first tracing the outlines accurately with soft cotton,
  then taking stitches from point to point of the part to be raised, so
  as to have the greatest thickness of cotton in the centre, and sewing
  it over, in stitches taken close together, but slightly slanting, and
  completely across the part outlined. The veining of leaves is
  generally formed by taking the stitches from the vein to the edge,
  first on one side and then on the other. The borders of embroidered
  muslin collars, &amp;c., are usually finished with buttonhole stitch,
  worked either the width of an ordinary buttonhole, or in long
  stitches, and raised like satin stitch. Eyelet holes are made by
  piercing round holes with a stiletto, and sewing them round.

<br>
  The kind of frame on which muslin is most easily worked, consists of
  two hoops of wood, about eight inches in diameter. One is rather
  smaller than the other. On it the muslin is stretched, and the larger
  one being slipped over it, and fitting tightly, keeps the muslin in
  its place.

<br>
  It requires considerable care to work well with ombre silks, to avoid
  incorrect shading. Nature should be followed as closely as possible.
  Not only must the form be carefully preserved, but the lights and
  shades must be disposed in an artistic manner. For instance: the point
  of a leaf is never the darkest part, nor should the lower leaves and
  flowers of a group of the same kind be light.

<br>
  The materials for canvas work and embroidery may be classed under the
  names of wool, silk, chenille, and braid; beads, straw, and a variety
  of other fancy materials, are also brought into use. A knowledge of
  the proper mode of using them, and the varieties of each which are
  made, is one of the most useful things it is possible for the amateur
  needle-woman to become acquainted with. We will, therefore, take them
  in their order.

<a name="p1873"></a><b><i>1873. &nbsp;Wool</i></b><br>
<br>
  German wool (or Berlin wool, as it is commonly called) is the most
  beautiful material manufactured for canvas-work. The vast variety of
  shades, the exquisite tints produced, the softness and evenness of the
  fabric, are beyond all praise. We speak of Berlin wool <i>as it ought to
  be</i>; for no article is more frequently of inferior quality. From damp,
  or bad packing, or many other causes, it is frequently crushed and
  injured, and in that state is not fit to be used for good work. Berlin
  wool is supposed to be all dyed, as well as made, abroad; at present a
  large proportion is entirely produced in our own country, which is
  little, if at all, inferior to the foreign. Berlin wool is made only
  in two sizes, 4-thread and 8-thread; unless the latter is specified in
  directions, the other is always implied.<br>
<br>
  Berlin wools are either dyed in one colour, or in shades of the same
  colour, or (<i>very rarely</i>) in shades of several colours. Technically,
  a silk or wool dyed in shades of the same colour, going gradually from
  light to dark, and from dark to light again, is termed an <i>ombre</i>, or
  <i>shaded</i> wool or silk, whereas <i>chine</i> is the term employed when there
  are several <i>colours</i> used. There are, also, what are called <i>short</i>
  and <i>long</i> shades; that is, in the former the entire shades, from the
  lightest to the lightest again, will occur within a short space, a
  yard or so; whereas, in <i>long</i> shades the gradation is much more
  gradually made.<br>
<br>
  We notice these apparently trifling differences that readers may
  comprehend the importance of obtaining precisely the proper materials
  for each design. If we prescribe a certain article, it is because <i>it</i>
  and no other will give the effect. Transparent, white, or silver beads
  are usually worked with white silk, but clear glass beads, threaded on
  cerise silk, produce a peculiarly rich effect by the coloured silk
  shining through transparent glass. The silk used must be extremely
  fine, as the beads vary much in size. A change of material, which
  might appear of no consequence whatever, would completely spoil the
  effect of the design.

  This well known production of the silk-worm in its natural state, as

  used for weaving it requires to be twisted, or, as it is technically
  termed, "thrown;" that is to say, it is not two threads twisted one
  over the other, but the single filament itself is twisted so as to
  render it firmer; this is termed "singles." The next process is termed
  "tram." This is two threads loosely twisted together. This usually
  constitutes the "weft" silk, which is thrown by the shuttle across the

<a name="p1887"></a><b><i>1887. &nbsp;Organzine</i></b><br>
<br>
  Organzine, or hard silk, generally constitutes the "warp," or length
  of the silk. This is made by first twisting each individual thread of
  silk, and then two or more of the threads are twisted together by the
  "throwing" mill (throw one thread over the other). In this state it
  must be boiled, to discharge the gum which renders the silk hard to
  the touch, and unfit to receive the dye. It is now boiled in soap and
  water for four hours, and then boiled in clear water to discharge the
  soap; after which it is glossy, soft, and fit for wearing.

<br>
  Filoselle silk was formerly a "spun silk," and the product chiefly of
  the silkworm, which naturally eats its way through its cocoon. It is
  only comparatively of late years that this silk has been used. The
  short filaments are spun in the same way that cotton and wool are
  spun, and is afterwards woven. A great deal of this silk is used for
  stockings and socks, and for weaving in with wool-fabrics, but there
  is also another kind of Filoselle used in needlework. This is
  two-thread silk, or "tram." Eight or ten of these slightly twisted
  threads form a strand of silk, so that, according to the purpose
  required, one, two, or more threads of it can be used for embroidery.
  This is glossy as satin.

  In stems a long stitch is made, and then a second halfway the length
  of the first, and half-way beyond it, till a stem is formed; and to
  complete it work from right to left, placing the needle under a stitch
  of the stem, not of the material, and so work back upon the top of the
  previous stitches. In the stem first worked only the tiniest piece of
  the material is taken up on the needle, so that the wool or silk is
  all on the surface.

<a name="p1907"></a><b><i>1907. &nbsp;Mode of doing Canvas Work</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is always done by the thread,&mdash;particular care should in all
  cases be taken that the size of the various materials is properly
  proportioned. Placing the canvas in a frame, technically termed
  <i>dressing the frame</i>, is an operation which requires considerable
  care. The frame itself, especially for a large piece of work, should
  be substantially made; otherwise the stress upon it will be apt to
  warp it, and drag the canvas. If this occurs to any extent, the injury
  can never be repaired.

<br>
  After herringboning the raw edges of the canvas, sew them, <i>by</i> the
  thread, to the webbing of the frame,&mdash;that is, to the top and bottom.
  Then stretch the ends till the canvas is extended to its utmost
  length, put in the pegs, and brace the sides with fine twine. If the
  canvas is too long for the frame, and any part has to be rolled over
  the end, let the wood be first covered with a few thicknesses of
  silver paper.

<a name="p1909"></a><b><i>1909. &nbsp;Design on Cloth</i></b><br>
<br>
  Sometimes, to save the trouble of grounding, a design is worked on
  cloth, over which canvas is laid. Whenever this is the case, the cloth
  must be carefully damped, to remove the gloss, before it is put into
  the frame. Then, as cloth will always stretch much more than canvas,
  it must be cut a little smaller both ways. The raw edges of the cloth
  should be turned in, and tacked to the canvas before they are framed.
  Some people withdraw the threads of canvas after the work is done; but
  it has a much richer effect if the threads of canvas are cut close to
  the outer stitches; and if there are any small spaces in the pattern,
  where the ground should be seen, they may be worked in wool of the
  colour of the ground.

<br>
  Tapestry painting is an imitation of the famed Gobelin tapestry, which
  is hand-woven over fine cord. The imitation is painted on a
  machine-woven rep canvas: the term rep is a corruption of the Saxon
  term <i>wrepp</i>, or <i>rape</i>, a cord, Dutch <i>roop</i>, from which we get the
  word rope. In the Gobelins the shading of the different tints of wool
  that form a picture, or other designs, are put in by hand work, or
  shuttles moved by the hand, and on the wrong side of the picture, and
  the threads of wool, the weft run longitudinally, not horizontally, so
  that when the design is finished the picture is turned horizontally,
  and is complete. In Tapestry Painting the <i>rep</i> of the canvas is from
  right to left (horizontal), and this is then painted over and forms a
  picture in imitation of the Gobelin tapestry. The latter is so named
  after its French inventor, Giles Gobelin, about 1520. He was a famous
  dyer who discovered the celebrated Gobelin's scarlet dye. The house in
  which he lived was purchased by Louis XIV for a manufactory of
  tapestry for adorning palaces, the designs for which were drawn by Le
  Brun, a celebrated French painter, about 1666. Her Majesty Queen
  Victoria has recently caused to be established at Windsor, an
  establishment where the art of making "Gobelin Tapestry" is
  successfully taught.

<br>
  A black coat and trousers are indispensable for a dinner, or a ball.
  Either a white or black waistcoat is proper on such occasions. Morning
  dress is sufficient for an ordinary visit of ceremony.

<br>
  Ladies' dresses should be chosen so as to produce an agreeable
  harmony. Never put on a dark-coloured bonnet with a light spring
  costume. Avoid uniting colours which will suggest an epigram; such as
  a straw-coloured dress with a green bonnet.

<a name="p1930"></a><b><i>1930. &nbsp;Arrangement of the Hair</i></b><br>
<br>
  The arrangement of the hair is most important. Bands are becoming to
  faces of a Grecian caste. Ringlets better suit lively and expressive
  heads. Avoid the extremes of fashion, whatever the fashion may be,
  especially those fashions which tend to spoil the hair and render it
  unfitted for plainer styles.

<a name="p1933"></a><b><i>1933. &nbsp;Simplicity and Grace</i></b><br>
<br>
  The most elegant dress loses its character if it is not worn with
  grace. Young girls have often an air of constraint, and their dress
  seems to partake of their want of ease. In speaking of her toilet, a
  women should not convey the idea that her whole skill consists in
  adjusting tastefully some trifling ornaments. A simple style of dress
  is an indication of modesty.

<br>
  The hands should receive special attention. They are the outward signs
  of general cleanliness. The same may be said of the face, the neck,
  the ears, and the teeth. The cleanliness of the system generally, and
  of bodily apparel, pertains to Health, and is treated of under this
  head.

  There is considerable art in using this accessory of dress and

<br>
  Never be without a handkerchief. Hold it freely in the hand, and do
  not roll it into a ball. Hold it by the centre, and let the corners
  form a fan-like expansion. Avoid using it too much. With some persons
  the habit becomes troublesome and unpleasant.

  Special licences are dispensations from the ordinary rule, under which

  other places duly licensed for that purpose. They can only be obtained
  from the Metropolitan or archbishop of the province, and often with no

  Common Licences enable persons of full age, or minors with consent of

  ceremony is over, the parties repair to the vestry, and enter their

  and the witnesses present, and a certificate of the registry is given
  to the bridegroom if desired. The charge for a certificate of marriage
  is 2s. 7d., including the penny stamp on the documents, as by law

<br>
  An Act was passed in the reign of William the Fourth, by which it was
  rendered legal for persons wishing to be married by a civil ceremony,
  to give notice of their intention to the Registrar of Marriages in
  their district or districts. Three weeks' notice is necessary, to give
  which the parties call, separately or together, at the office of the
  registrar, who enters the names in a book.  When the time of notice
  has expired, it is only necessary to give the registrar an intimation,
  on the previous day, of your intention to attend at his office on the
  next day, and complete the registration. The ceremony consists of
  merely answering a few questions, and making the declaration that you
  take each other to live as husband and wife.  The fee amounts only to
  a few shillings, and in this form no wedding ring is required, though
  it is usually placed on the ring-finger of the bride's left hand, in
  the presence of the persons assembled. The married couple receive a
  certificate of marriage, which is in every respect lawful.

<a name="p1943"></a><b><i>1943. &nbsp;Wedding Dress</i></b><br>
<br>
  It is impossible to lay down specific rules for dress, as fashions
  change, and tastes differ.  The great art consists in selecting the
  style of dress most becoming to the person. A stout person should
  adopt a different style from a thin person; a taLl one from a short
  one. Peculiarities of complexion, and form of face and figure, should
  be duly regarded; and in these matters there is no better course than
  to call in the aid of any respectable milliner and dressmaker, who
  will be found ready and able to give the best advice. The bridegroom
  should simply appear in morning dress, and should avoid everything
  eccentric and conspicuous in style. The bridesmaids should always be
  made aware of the bride's dress before they choose their own, which
  should be determined by a proper harmony with the former.

<br>
The order of going to church is as follows:&mdash;The <b>Bride</b>, accompanied by
  her <i>father</i>, occupies the <i>last carriage</i>. The father hands out the
  bride, and leads her direct to the altar, round which those who have
  been invited have already grouped themselves, leaving room for the
  father, the bride, and the bridesmaids, who usually await the bride's
  coming at the entrance to the church, or at the bottom of the chancel,
  and follow her to the communion rails.

<br>
  The Bridegroom, who has made his way to the church, accompanied by his
  "best man," or principal groomsman &mdash;an intimate friend or
  brother&mdash;should be waiting at the communion rails to receive his
  future wife on her arrival. He and she then stand facing the altar, he
  being on the right of the bride, and the father or the gentleman who
  is to "give away" the bride, on the left.

  return thereto. If a large party, the bride and bridegroom occupy
  seats in the centre of the long table, and the two extremities should
  be presided over by the father and mother of the bride, or, failing
  these, by elderly relatives, if possible one from each family.
  Everyone should endeavour to make the occasion as happy as possible. 
  One of the senior members of either the bride or bridegroom's family
  should, sometime before the breakfast has terminated, rise, and in a
  brief but graceful manner, propose the "Health and happiness of the
  wedded pair." It is much better to drink their healths together than
  separately; and, after a brief interval, the bridegroom should return
  thanks, which he may do without hesitation, since no one looks for a
  speech upon such an occasion. A few words, feelingly expressed, are
  all that is required. The breakfast generally concludes with the
  departure of the happy pair upon their wedding tour.

<a name="p1951"></a><b><i>1951. &nbsp;Cards</i></b><br>
<br>
  A newly married couple send out cards immediately after the ceremony
  to their friends and acquaintance, who, on their part, return either
  notes or cards of congratulation on the event. As soon as the lady is
  settled in her new home, she may expect the calls of her acquaintance;
  for which it is not absolutely necessary to remain at home, although
  politeness requires that they should be returned as soon as possible.
  But, having performed this, any further intercourse may be avoided
  (where it is deemed necessary) by a polite refusal of invitations.
  Where cards are to be left, the number must be determined according to
  the various members of which the family called upon is composed. For
  instance, where there are the mother, aunt, and daughters (the latter
  having been introduced to society), three cards should be left.
  Recently, the custom of sending cards has been in a great measure
  discontinued, and instead of this, the words "No cards" are appended
  to the ordinary newspaper advertisement, and the announcement of the
  marriage, with this addition, is considered all sufficient.

<br>
  When the married pair have returned, and the day of reception arrives,
  wedding cake and wine are handed round, of which every one partakes,
  and each expresses some kindly wish for the newly married couple. The
  bride ought not to receive visitors without a mother, or sister, or
  some friend being present, not even if her husband be at home.
  Gentlemen who are in professions, or have Government appointments,
  cannot always await the arrival of visitors; when such is the case,
  some old friend of the family should represent him, and proffer an
  apology for his absence.

<br>
  The Wedding Tour must depend upon the tastes and circumstances of the
  married couple. Home-loving Englishmen and women may find much to
  admire and enjoy without ranging abroad. Those whose time is somewhat
  restricted should visit some spot which may be reached without
  difficulty. Cornwall and Devonshire, the Isle of Wight, &amp;c., are each
  delightful to the tourist; and the former is now accessible by railway
  as far as the Land's End. The scenery of the North of Devon, and of
  both coasts of Cornwall, is especially beautiful. North Wales offers a
  delightful excursion; the lakes of Westmoreland and Cumberland; the
  lakes of Killarney, in Ireland; also the magnificent scenery of the
  Scottish lakes and mountains. To those who wish for a wider range,
  France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Rhine offer charms which cannot
  be surpassed.

  agree among themselves to do all that is possible to reduce

  many now content themselves with wearing a simple band of cloth round
  the left arm. This is done by women as well as by men.

  articles of the marriage contract, when it was agreed that the dowry
  should be paid down on the wedding day or soon after. On this occasion
  there was commonly a feast, at the conclusion of which the man gave to
  the woman, as a pledge, a ring, which she put on the fourth finger of
  her left hand, <i>because it was believed that a nerve reached thence to
  the heart</i>, and a day was then named for the marriage.

<blockquote>"We have remarked on the vulgar error which supposes that an artery
    runs from the fourth finger of the left hand to the heart. It is
    said by Swinburn and others, that therefore it became the wedding
    finger. The priesthood kept up this idea by still retaining it as
    the wedding finger, but the custom is really associated with the
    doctrine of the Trinity; for, in the ancient ritual of English
    marriages, the ring was placed by the husband on the top of the
    thumb of the left hand, with the words, 'In the name of the father;'
    he then removed it to the forefinger, saying, 'In the name of the
    Son;' then to the middle finger, adding, 'And of the Holy Ghost;'
    finally, he left it as now, on the fourth finger, with the closing
    word, 'Amen.' "</blockquote>

<br>
  The true art of being agreeable is to appear well pleased with all the
  company, and rather to seem well entertained with them than to bring
  entertainment to them. A man thus disposed, perhaps may not have much
  learning, nor any wit; but if he has common sense and something
  friendly in his behaviour, it conciliates men's minds more than the
  brightest parts without this disposition; and when a man of such a
  turn comes up to old age, he is almost sure to be treated with
  respect. It is true, indeed, that we should not dissemble and flatter
  in company; but a man may be very agreeable, strictly, consistent with
  truth and sincerity, by a prudent silence where he cannot concur, and
  a pleasing assent where he can. Now and then you meet a person so
  exactly formed to please, that he will gain upon everyone that hears
  or beholds him: this disposition is not merely the gift of nature, but
  frequently the effect of much knowledge of the world, and a command
  over the passions.

<br>
  Artificial manners, and such as spring from good taste and refinement,
  can never be mistaken, and differ as widely as gold and tinsel. How
  captivating is gentleness of manner derived from true humility, and
  how faint is every imitation! That suavity of manner which renders a
  real gentlewoman courteous to all, and careful to avoid giving
  offence, is often copied by those who merely subject themselves to
  certain rules of etiquette: but very awkward is the copy. Warm
  professions of regard are bestowed on those who do not expect them,
  and the esteem which is due to merit appears to be lavished on every
  one alike. And as true humility, blended with a right appreciation of
  self-respect, gives a pleasing cast to the countenance, so from a
  sincere and open disposition springs that artlessness of manner which
  disarms all prejudice. Feeling, on the contrary, is ridiculous when
  affected, and, even when real, should not be too openly manifested.
  Let the manners arise from the mind, and let there be no disguise for
  the genuine emotions of the heart.

<br>
  Avoid falsehood. There can be found no higher virtue than the love of
  truth. The man who deceives others must himself become the victim of
  morbid distrust. Knowing the deceit of his own heart, and the
  falsehood of his own tongue, his eyes must be always filled with
  suspicion, and he must lose the greatest of all happiness&mdash;confidence
  in those who surround him.

<a name="p1991"></a><b><i>1991. &nbsp;Good Temper</i></b><br>
<br>
  Avoid Manifestations of Ill-temper. Reason is given for man's
  guidance. Passion is the tempest by which reason is overthrown. Under
  the effects of passion, man's mind becomes disordered, his face
  disfigured, his body deformed. A moment's passion has frequently cut
  off a life's friendship, destroyed a life's hope, embittered a life's
  peace, and brought unending sorrow and disgrace. It is scarcely worth
  while to enter into a comparative analysis of ill-temper and passion;
  they are alike discreditable, alike injurious, and should stand
  equally condemned.

<a name="p1992"></a><b><i>1992. &nbsp;Be Humble</i></b><br>
<br>
  Avoid Pride. If you are handsome, God made you so; if you are learned,
  some one instructed you; if you are rich, God gave you what you own.
  It is for others to perceive your goodness; but you should be blind to
  your own merits. There can be no comfort in deeming yourself better
  than you really are: that is self-deception. The best men throughout
  all history have been the most humble.

<a name="p1993"></a><b><i>1993. &nbsp;Affectation is a Form of Pride</i></b><br>
<br>
It is, in fact, pride made ridiculous and contemptible. Some one
  writing upon affectation has remarked as follows:

    <blockquote>"If anything will sicken and disgust a man, it is the affected,
    mincing way in which some people choose to talk. It is perfectly
    nauseous. If these young jackanapes, who screw their words into all
    manner of diabolical shapes, could only feel how perfectly
    disgusting they were, it might induce them to drop it. With many, it
    soon becomes such a confirmed habit that they cannot again be taught
    to talk in a plain, straightforward, manly way. In the lower order
    of ladies' boarding-schools, and indeed, too much everywhere, the
    same sickening, mincing tone is too often found. Do, pray, good
    people, do talk in your natural tone, if you don't wish to be
    utterly ridiculous and contemptible."</blockquote>

<a name="p1994"></a><b><i>1994. &nbsp;Vulgarity</i></b><br>
<br>
  We have adopted the foregoing Paragraph because we approve of some of
  its sentiments, but chiefly because it shows that persons who object
  to affectation may go to the other extreme&mdash;vulgarity. It is vulgar,
  we think, to call even the most affected people "jackanapes, who screw
  their words into all manner of diabolical shapes." Avoid vulgarity in
  manner, in speech, and in correspondence. To conduct yourself vulgarly
  is to offer offence to those who are around you; to bring upon
  yourself the condemnation of persons of good taste; and to incur the
  penalty of exclusion from good society. Thus, cast among the vulgar,
  you become the victim of your own error.

<a name="p1995"></a><b><i>1995. &nbsp;Avoid Swearing</i></b><br>
<br>
  An oath is but the wrath of a perturbed spirit. It is <i>mean</i>. A man of
  high moral standing would rather treat an offence with contempt than
  show his indignation by an oath.  It is <i>vulgar</i>, altogether too low
  for a decent man. It is <i>cowardly</i>, implying a fear either of not
  being believed or obeyed. It is <i>ungentlemanly</i>, A gentleman,
  according to Webster, is a <i>genteel</i> man&mdash;well-bred, refined. It is
  <i>indecent</i>, offensive to delicacy, and extremely unfit for human ears.
  It is <i>foolish</i>. "Want of decency is want of sense." It is
  <i>abusive</i>&mdash;to the mind which conceives the oath, to the tongue which
  utters it, and to the person at whom it is aimed. It is <i>venomous</i>,
  showing a man's heart to be as a nest of vipers; and every time he
  swears, one of them starts out from his head. It is <i>contemptible</i>,
  forfeiting the respect of all the wise and good. It is <i>wicked</i>,
  violating the Divine law, and provoking the displeasure of Him who
  will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.

<a name="p1996"></a><b><i>1996. &nbsp;Be a Gentleman</i></b><br>
<br>
  Moderation, decorum, and neatness distinguish the gentleman; he is at
  all times affable, diffident, and studious to please. Intelligent and
  polite, his behaviour is pleasant and graceful. When he enters the
  dwelling of an inferior, he endeavours to hide, if possible, the
  difference between their ranks of life; ever willing to assist those
  around him, he is neither unkind, haughty, nor over-bearing. In the
  mansions of the rich, the correctness of his mind induces him to bend
  to etiquette, but not to stoop to adulation; correct principle
  cautions him to avoid the gaming-table, inebriety, or any other foible
  that could occasion him self-reproach. Gratified with the pleasures of
  reflection, he rejoices to see the gaieties of society, and is
  fastidious upon no point of little import. Appear only to be a
  gentleman, and its shadow will bring upon you contempt; be a
  gentleman, and its honours will remain even after you are dead.

  Happy indeed is the child who, during the first period of its
  existence, is fed upon no other aliment than the milk of its mother,
  or that of a healthy nurse. If other food become necessary before the
  child has acquired teeth, it ought to be of a liquid form; for
  instance, biscuits or stale bread boiled in an equal mixture of milk
  and water, to the consistence of a thick soup; but by no means even
  this in the first week of its life. Children who are brought up by
  hand, that is to say, who are not nursed by mother or wet nurse,
  require an occasioned change of diet, and thin gruel affords a
  wholesome alternation to milk. When cows' milk is used it should be
  obtained, if possible, from one and the same cow, and diluted with
  boiled water.  Swiss milk is recommended by some medical men. The
  Aylesbury Dairy Company furnish a speciality for young children under
  the name of "Artificial Human Milk," which is recommended.

  infants make an exception; for, as their consumption of vital power is
  more rapid, they may be more frequently indulged with aliment.

  It is, however, advisable to accustom even them to a certain
  regularity, so as to allow them their victuals at stated periods of
  the day; for it has been observed that those children which are fed
  indiscriminately through the whole day, are subject to debility and
  disease. The stomach should be allowed to recover its tone, and to
  collect the juices necessary for digestion, before it is supplied with
  a new portion of food.

<br>
  The following Order of giving Food to children has been found proper,
  and conducive to their health:&mdash;After rising in the morning, suppose
  about six o'clock, a moderate portion of lukewarm milk, with well
  baked bread, which should by no means be new; at nine o'clock, bread
  with some fruit, or, if fruit be scarce, a small quantity of fresh
  butter; about twelve o'clock, the dinner, of a sufficient quantity;
  between four and five o'clock, some bread with fruit, or, in winter,
  some preserve as a substitute for fruit.

<a name="p2034"></a><b><i>2034. &nbsp;Tea</i></b><br>
<br>
  On this Occasion, Children should be allowed to eat till they are
  satisfied, without surfeiting themselves, that they may not crave for
  a heavy supper, which disturbs their rest, and is productive of bad
  humours: lastly, about seven o'clock they may be permitted a light
  supper, consisting either of milk, soup, fruit, or boiled vegetables
  and the like, but neither meat nor mealy dishes, nor any article of
  food which produces flatulency; in short, they ought then to eat but
  little, and remain awake at least for an hour after it.

<a name="p2035"></a><b><i>2035. &nbsp;Bread</i></b><br>
<br>
  It has often been contended that Bread is hurtful to children; but
  this applies only to new bread, or such as is not sufficiently baked;
  for instance, nothing can be more hurtful or oppressive than rolls,
  muffins, and crumpets. Good wheaten bread, especially that baked by
  the aerated process, is extremely proper during the first years of
  infancy; but that made of whole wheat meal, or wheat flour from which
  the bran has not been eliminated is, perhaps, more conducive to health
  after the age of childhood.

<br>
  It is improper and pernicious to keep infants continually at the
  breast; and it would be less hurtful, nay, even judicious, to let them
  cry for a few nights, rather than to fill them incessantly with milk,
  which readily turns sour on the stomach, weakens the digestive organs,
  and ultimately generates scrofulous affections.

<br>
  In the latter part of the First Year, pure water, milk-and-water, or

  young child be permitted to taste beer or wine, unless specially

  drink water only, bestow on them a fortune, the value and importance
  of which will be sensibly felt through life.

<br>
  Many Children acquire a Habit of Drinking during their meals; it would
  be more conducive to digestion if they were accustomed to drink only
  after having made a meal. This salutary rule is too often neglected,
  though it is certain that inundations of the stomach, during the
  mastication and maceration of the food, not only vitiate digestion,
  but they may be attended with other bad consequences; as cold drink,
  when brought in contact with the teeth previously heated, may easily
  occasion cracks or chinks in these useful bones, and pave the way for
  their carious dissolution.

<br>
  If we Inquire into the Cause which produces the crying of infants, we
  shall find that it seldom originates from pain, or uncomfortable
  sensations, for those who are apt to imagine that such causes must
  <i>always</i> operate on the body of an infant, are egregiously mistaken;
  inasmuch as they conceive that the physical condition, together with
  the method of expressing sensations, is the same in infants and adults.

<br>
  We observe, for instance, that a child, as soon as it is undressed, or
  disencumbered from swaddling clothes, moves its arms and legs, and
  often makes a variety of strong exertions; yet no reasonable person
  would suppose that such attempts arise from a preternatural or

<br>
  It is therefore equally absurd to draw an unfavourable inference from

  In the First Period of Life, such exertions are almost the only

  Mutton and poultry are the best.  Birds and the white meat of fowls
  are the most delicate food of this kind that can be given. These meats
  should be slowly cooked, and no gravy, if made rich with butter,
  should be eaten by a young child, Never give children hard, tough,

  For children rice ought to be cooked in no more water than is
  necessary to swell it; apples roasted, or stewed with no more water
  than is necessary to steam them; vegetables so well cooked as to make
  them require little butter, and less digestion; eggs boiled slowly and
  soft. The boiling of milk ought to be directed by the state of the
  bowels; if flatulent or bilious, a very little currie-powder may be
  given with vegetables with good effect. Turmeric and the warm seeds
  (not hot peppers) are also particularly useful in such cases.

  children, let them be seasoned with mint and salt, which will take off
  the flatulency. If they are old, let them be pulped, as the skins
  cannot be digested by children's stomachs. Never give them vegetables

<a name="p2085"></a><b><i>2085. &nbsp;Fruits for Children</i></b><br>
<br>
That fruits are naturally healthy in their season, if rightly taken,
  no one who believes that the Creator is a kind and beneficent Being
  can doubt. And yet the use of summer fruits appears often to cause
  most fatal diseases, especially in children. Why is this? Because we
  do not conform to the natural laws in using this kind of diet. These
  laws are very simple, and easy to understand. Let the fruit be ripe
  when you eat it; and eat when you require <i>food</i>. Fruits that have
  <i>seeds</i> are much more wholesome than the <i>stone</i> fruits. But all
  fruits are better, for very young children, if baked or cooked in some
  manner, and eaten with bread. The French always eat bread with raw
  fruit. Apples and winter pears are very excellent food for
  children,&mdash;indeed, for almost any person in health,&mdash;but best when
  eaten for breakfast or dinner. If taken late in the evening, fruit
  often proves injurious. The old saying, that apples are <i>gold in the
  morning, silver at noon, and lead at night</i>, is pretty near the truth.
  Both apples and pears are often good and nutritious when baked or
  stewed, and when prepared in this way are especially suitable for
  those delicate constitutions that cannot bear raw fruit. Much of the
  fruit gathered when unripe might be rendered fit for food by
  preserving in sugar.

  sugar to every pound of fruit; boil the whole together gently for an
  hour, or till the blackberries are soft, stirring and mashing them
  well. Preserve it like any other jam, and it will be found very useful
  in families, particularly for children, regulating their bowels, and
  enabling you to dispense with cathartics. It may be used in the
  ordinary way in roll-over puddings, and for tarts, or spread on bread
  instead of butter; and even when the blackberries are bought, it is
  cheaper than butter. In the country every family should preserve at

  The oddity of these "wonders" consists solely in the manner of
  cooking, and the shape consequent. Take two pounds of flour, six
  ounces of butter, six ounces of white sugar, a little nutmeg, ground
  ginger, and lemon peel; beat eight eggs, and knead them all well
  together; a taste of brandy will be an improvement.  Roll the paste
  into a long mass about the thickness of your wrist; cut off a slice
  and roll it into an oval, about four inches long and three inches
  wide, not too thin; cut two slits in it, but not through either end,
  there will then be three bands. Pass the left one through the aperture
  to the right, and throw it into a <i>brass</i> or <i>bell-metal</i> skillet of
  <b>boiling</b> lard or beef or mutton dripping. You may cook three or four at
  a time.  In about two minutes turn them with a fork, and you will find
  them browned, and swollen or risen in two or three minutes more.
  Remove them from the pan to a dish, when they will dry and cool.

<a name="p2097"></a><b><i>2097. &nbsp;Muffins</i></b><br>
<br>
  Add a pint and a half of good ale yeast (from pale malt, if possible)
  to a bushel of the very best white flour; let the yeast lie all night
  in water, then pour off the water quite clear; heat two gallons of
  water just milk-warm, and mix the water, yeast, and two ounces of salt
  well together for about a quarter of an hour. Strain the whole, and
  mix up your dough as light as possible, letting it lie in the trough
  an hour to rise; next roll it with your hand, pulling it into little
  pieces about the size of a large walnut. These must be rolled out thin
  with a rolling-pin, in a good deal of flour, and if covered
  immediately with a piece of flannel, they will rise to a proper
  thickness; but if too large or small, dough must be added accordingly,
  or taken away; meanwhile, the dough must be also covered with flannel.<br>
<br>
  Next begin baking; and when laid on the iron, watch carefully, and
  when one side changes colour, turn the other, taking care that they do
  not burn or become discoloured. Be careful also that the iron does not
  get too hot. In order to bake muffins properly, you ought to have a
  place built as if a copper were to be set; but instead of copper a
  piece of iron must be put over the top, fixed in form like the bottom
  of an iron pot, underneath which a coal fire is kindled when required.
  Toast the muffins crisp on both sides with a fork; pull them open
  <i>with your hand</i>, and they will be like a honeycomb; lay in as much
  butter as you intend; then clap them together, and set by the fire:
  turn them once, that both sides may be buttered alike. When quite
  done, cut them across with a knife; but if you use a knife either to
  spread or divide them, they will be as heavy as lead. Some kinds of
  flour will soak up more water than others; when this occurs, add
  water; or if too moist, add flour: for the dough must be as light as
  possible.

Extract the juice from red currants by simmering them very gently for
  a few minutes over a slow fire; strain it through folded muslin, and
  to one pound of the juice add a pound and a half of freshly gathered
  cooking apples, pared, and rather deeply cored, that the fibrous part
  may be avoided. Boil these quite slowly until the mixture is perfectly
  smooth; then, to evaporate part of the moisture, let the boiling be
  quickened. In from twenty-five to thirty minutes, draw the pan from
  the fire, and throw in gradually a pound and a quarter of sugar in
  fine powder; mix it well with the fruit, and when it is dissolved,
  continue the boiling rapidly for twenty minutes longer, keeping the
  mixture constantly stirred; put it into a mould, and store it, when
  cold, for winter use, or serve it for dessert, or for the second

  It is better to buy the feet of the butcher, than at the tripe-shop

  with water; skim well, and let them boil gently for six or seven
  hours, until reduced to about two quarts, then strain and skim off any
  oily substance on the surface. It is best to boil the feet the day
  before making the jelly, as, when the liquor is cold, the oily part
  being at the top, and the other being firm, with pieces of blotting
  paper applied to it, you may remove every particle of the oily
  substance without wasting the liquor. Put the liquor in a stewpan to
  melt, with a pound of lump sugar, the peel of two lemons, and the
  juice of six, six whites and shells of eggs beat together, and a
  bottle of sherry or Madeira; whisk the whole together until it is on

  quarter of an hour; strain it through a jelly-bag: what is strained
  first must be poured into the bag again, until it is as bright and

  Select the largest Seville oranges, as they usually contain the

  the skins form the largest part of the marmalade. Weigh the oranges,
  and weigh also an equal quantity of loaf sugar. Peel the oranges,
  dividing the peel of each into quarters, and put them into a

  to boil. In the meantime prepare your oranges; divide them into gores,
  then scrape with a teaspoon all the pulp from the white skin; or,
  instead of peeling the oranges, cut a hole in the orange and scoop out
  the pulp: remove carefully all the pips, of which there are
  innumerable small ones in the Seville orange, which will escape
  observation unless they are very minutely examined. Have a large basin
  near you with some cold water in it, to throw the pips and peels
  into&mdash;a pint is sufficient for a dozen oranges.<br>

  Boil these in the water, and having strained off the glutinous matter
  which comes from them, add it to the other parts. When the peels have
  boiled till they are sufficiently tender to admit of a fork being
  stuck into them, scrape away all the pith from the inside of them; lay
  them in folds, and cut them into thin slices of about an inch long.
  Clarify the sugar; then throw the peels and pulp into it, stir it
  well, and let it boil for half an hour. Then remove it from the fire,
  and when it becomes cool, put it by in pots. Marmalade should be made

  chopped small, and rolled with a rolling pin.&mdash;Almond Paste may be

<a name="p2142"></a><b><i>2142. &nbsp;Freezing without Ice or Acids</i></b><br>
<br>
  The use of ice in cooling depends upon the fact of its requiring a
  vast quantity of heat to convert it from a solid into a liquid state,
  or in other words, to melt it; and the heat so required is obtained
  from those objects with which it may be in contact. A pound of ice
  requires nearly as much heat to melt it as would be sufficient to make
  a pound of cold water boiling hot; hence its cooling power is
  extremely great. But ice does not begin to melt until the temperature
  is above the freezing point, and therefore it cannot be employed in
  freezing liquids, &amp;c., but only in cooling them. If, however, any
  substance is mixed with ice which is capable of causing it to melt
  more rapidly, and at a lower temperature, a still more intense cooling
  effect is the result; such a substance is common salt, and the degree
  of cold produced by the mixture of one part of salt with two parts of
  snow or pounded ice is greater than thirty degrees below freezing.<br>
<br>
  In making ice-creams and dessert ices, the following articles are
  required:&mdash;Pewter ice-pots with tightly-fitting lids, furnished with
  handles; wooden ice-pails, to hold the rough ice and salt&mdash;the pails
  should be stoutly made, about the same depth as the ice pots, and nine
  or ten inches more in diameter, with a hole in the side, fitted with a
  good cork, in order that the water from the melted ice may be drawn
  off as required. In addition, a broad spatula, about four inches long,
  rounded at the end, and furnished with a long wooden handle, is
  necessary to scrape the frozen cream from the sides of the ice-pot,
  and for mixing the whole smoothly together. When making ices, place
  the mixture of cream and fruit to be frozen in the ice-pot, cover it
  with the lid, and put the pot in the ice-pail, which proceed to fill
  up with coarsely-pounded ice and salt, in the proportion of about one
  part of salt to three of ice; let the whole remain a few minutes (if
  covered by a blanket so much the better), then whirl the pot briskly
  by the handle for a few minutes, take off the lid, and with the
  spatula scrape the iced cream from the sides, mixing the whole
  smoothly; put on the lid, and whirl again, repeating all the
  operations every few minutes until the whole of the cream is well
  frozen.<br>
<br>
  Great care and considerable labour are required in stirring, so that
  the whole cream may be smoothly frozen, and not in hard lumps. When
  finished, if it is required to be kept any time, the melted ice and
  salt should be allowed to escape, by removing the cork, and the pail
  filled up with fresh materials. It is scarcely necessary to add, that
  if any of the melted ice and salt is allowed to mix with the cream,
  the latter is spoiled. From the difficulty of obtaining ice in places
  distant from large towns, and in hot countries, and from the
  impracticability of keeping it any length of time, or, in fact, of
  keeping small quantities more than a few hours its use is much
  limited, and many have been the attempts to obtain an efficient
  substitute. For this purpose various salts have been employed, which,
  when dissolved in water, or in acids, absorb a sufficient amount of
  heat to freeze substances with which they may be placed in contact. We
  shall not attempt, in this article, to describe all the various
  freezing mixtures that have been devised, but speak only of those
  which have been found practically useful.<br>
<br>
  Many of the freezing mixtures which are to be found described in books
  are incorrectly so named, for although they themselves are below the
  freezing point, yet they are not sufficiently powerful to freeze any
  quantity of water, or other substances, when placed in a vessel within
  them. In order to be efficient as a freezing mixture, as distinguished
  from a cooling one, the materials used ought to be capable of
  producing by themselves an amount of cold more than thirty degrees
  below the freezing point of water, and this the ordinary mixtures will
  not do. Much more efficient and really freezing mixtures may be made
  by using acids to dissolve the salts. The cheapest, and perhaps the
  best, of these for ordinary use, is one which is frequently employed
  in France, both for making dessert ices, and cooling wines, &amp;c. It
  consists of coarsely powdered Glauber salt (sulphate of sodium), on
  which is poured about two-thirds its weight of spirit of salts
  (hydrochloric acid).<br>
<br>
  The mixture should be made in a wooden vessel, as that is preferable
  to one made of metal, which conducts the external heat to the
  materials with great rapidity; and when the substance to be cooled is
  placed in the mixture, the whole should be covered with a blanket, a
  piece of old woollen carpet doubled or some other non-conducting
  material, to prevent the access of the external warmth; the vessel
  used for icing wines should not be too large, that there may be no
  waste of the freezing mixture. This combination produces a degree of
  cold thirty degrees below freezing; and if the materials are bought of
  any of the wholesale druggists or dry salters, it is exceedingly
  economical. It is open, however, to the very great objection, that the
  spirit of salt is an exceedingly corrosive liquid, and of a pungent,
  disagreeable odour: this almost precludes its use for any purpose
  except that of icing wines.

<br>
Actual quantities&mdash;one pound of chloride of ammonium, or sal ammoniac,
  finely powdered, is to be <i>intimately</i> mixed with two pounds of
  nitrate of potassium or saltpetre, also in powder; this mixture we may
  call No. 1. No. 2 is formed by crushing three pounds of the best
  Scotch soda. In use, an equal bulk of both No. 1 and No. 2 is to be
  taken, stirred together, placed in the ice-pail, surrounding the
  ice-pot, and rather less cold water poured on than will dissolve the
  whole; if one quart of No. 1, and the same bulk of No. 2 are taken, it
  will require about one quart of water to dissolve them, and the
  temperature will fall, if the materials used are cool, to nearly
  thirty degrees below freezing. Those who fail, may trace their want of
  success to one or other of the following points:&mdash;the use of too small
  a quantity of the preparation,&mdash;the employment of a few ounces;
  whereas, in freezing ices, the ice-pot must be entirely surrounded
  with the freezing material: no one would attempt to freeze with four
  ounces of ice and salt. Again, too large a quantity of water may be
  used to dissolve the preparation, when all the excess of water has to
  be cooled down instead of the substance it is wished to freeze. All
  the materials used should be pure, and as cool as can be obtained. The
  ice-pail in which the mixture is made must be of some non-conducting
  material, as wood&mdash;which will prevent the access of warmth from the
  air; and the ice-pot, in which the liquor to be frozen is placed,
  should be of pewter, and surrounded nearly to its top by the freezing
  mixture. Bear in mind that the making of ice-cream, under any
  circumstances, is an operation requiring considerable dexterity and
  practice.

<a name="p2151"></a><b><i>2151. &nbsp;Nitrate of Ammonium as a Freezing Mixture</i></b><br>
<br>
  Another substance, which is free from any corrosive action or
  unpleasant odour, is nitrate of ammonium, which, if simply dissolved
  in rather less than its own weight of water, reduces the temperature
  about twenty-five degrees below freezing. The objections to its use
  are that its frigorific power is not sufficiently great to freeze
  readily; and if it be required to form dessert ices, it is requisite
  to renew the process, at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, a
  second time, and, if the weather is very hot, and the water used is
  rather warm, even a third or fourth time. Again, nitrate of ammonium
  is a very expensive salt; even in France, where it is manufactured
  expressly for this purpose, it is sold at the rate of three francs a
  pound; and in England it cannot be obtained under a much higher price.
  One great recommendation, however, attends its use, namely, that it
  may be recovered again, and used any number of times, by simply
  boiling away the water in which it is dissolved, by a gentle fire,
  until a small portion, on being removed, crystallizes on cooling.

If, however, nitrate of ammonium in coarse powder is put into the

  washing soda, and an equal quantity of the coldest water that can be
  obtained, an intensely powerful frigorific mixture is the result, the
  cold often falling to forty degrees below freezing.  This is by far
  the most efficacious freezing mixture that can be made without the use
  of ice or acids. But, unfortunately, it has an almost insuperable
  objection, that the nitrate of ammonium is decomposed by the soda, and
  cannot be recovered by evaporation; this raises the expense to so
  great a height, that the plan is practically useless.

<br>
  If the ordinary sal ammoniac of the shops is used, it will be found
  both difficult to powder, and expensive; in fact, it is so exceedingly
  tough, that the only way in which it can be easily divided, except in
  a drug mill, is by putting as large a quantity of the salt into water
  which is actually boiling as the latter will dissolve; as the solution
  cools, the salt crystalizes out in the solid form, and if stirred as
  it cools, it separates in a state of fine division. As this process is
  troublesome, and as the sal ammoniac is expensive, it is better to use
  the crude muriate of ammonium, which is the same substance as sal
  ammoniac, but before it has been purified by sublimation. This is not
  usually kept by druggists, but may be readily obtained of any of the
  artificial manure merchants, at a very moderate rate; and its purity
  may be readily tested by placing a portion of it on a red-hot iron,
  when it should fly off in a vapour, leaving scarcely any residue.

  together with a little bread steeped in water. This should be pressed
  and placed in one vessel, while in another should be put some boiled
  rape seed, washed in fresh water. Change the food every day. When they
  are a month old, put them into separate cages. Cut the claws of
  cage-birds occasionally, when they become too long, but in doing so be
  careful not to draw blood.

<a name="p2159"></a><b><i>2159. &nbsp; Treatment of Canaries</i></b><br>
<br>
  Care must be taken to keep canaries very clean. For this purpose, the
  cage should be strewed every morning with clean sand, or rather, fine
  gravel, for small pebbles are <i>absolutely essential</i> to life and
  health in cage-birds: fresh water must be given every day, both for
  drinking and bathing; the latter being in a shallow vessel; and,
  during the moulting season, a small bit of iron should be put into the
  water for drinking. The food of a canary should consist principally of
  <i>summer</i> rape seed that is, of those small <i>brown</i> rape seeds which
  are obtained from plants sown in the spring, and which ripen during
  the summer; large and <i>black</i> rape seeds, on the contrary, are
  produced by such plants as are sown in autumn and reaped in spring. A
  little chickweed in spring, lettuce leaves in summer, and endive in
  autumn, with slices of sweet apple in winter, may be safely given; but
  bread and sugar ought to be generally avoided. Occasionally, also, a
  few poppy or canary seeds, and a small quantity of bruised hemp seed
  may be added, but the last very sparingly.<br>
<br>
  Cleanliness, simple food, and fresh but not <i>cold</i> air, are essential
  to the well-being of a canary. During the winter, the cage should
  never be hung in a room without a fire, but even then, when the air is
  mild, and the sun shines bright, the little prisoner will be refreshed
  by having the window open. The cage should never be less than eight
  inches in diameter, and a foot high, with perches at different heights.

  occasionally rapeseed. The Germans sometimes give them a little

  teaching them to pipe, as a reward for the progress they make. Bird
  organs, or flageolets, are used to teach them. They breed three or
  four times a year. The young require to be kept very warm, and to be
  fed every two hours with rape seed, soaked for several hours in cold
  water, afterwards scalded and strained, bruised, mixed with bread, and
  moistened with milk. Not more than one, two, or three mouthfuls should
  be given at a time.

<br>
  The cock is recognised by the largeness of his eye, the length of his
  claws, the mode of erecting his crest, and by marks of white in the
  tail. It is also a larger bird than the hen. The cage should be of the
  following proportions:&mdash;Length, one foot five inches; width, nine
  inches; height, one foot three inches. There should be a circular
  projection in front to admit of a fresh turf being placed every two or
  three days, and the bottom of the cage should be plentifully and
  constantly sprinkled with river sand. All vessels containing food
  should be placed outside, and the top of the cage should be arched and
  padded, so that the bird may not injure itself by jumping about.<br>
<br>
  Their food, in a natural state, consists of seeds, insects, and also
  buds, green herbage, as clover, endive, lettuce, &amp;c., and occasionally
  berries. When confined, they are usually fed with a paste made in the
  following manner:&mdash;Take a portion of bread, well-baked and stale, put
  it into fresh water, and leave it until quite soaked through, then
  squeeze out the water and pour boiled milk over it, adding two-thirds
  of the same quantity of barley meal well sifted, or, what is better,
  wheat meal. This should be made fresh every two days. Occasionally the
  yolk of a hard-boiled egg should be crumbled small and given to the
  birds, as well as a little hemp seed, meal, worms, and elder berries
  when they can be got. The cages of these birds should be kept very
  clean.

  as street cries, and the whistling and shouts of boys at play, for
  they will imitate them, and become too noisy to be tolerated. Parrots
  may be fed upon soaked bread, biscuit, mashed potatoes, and rape seed.
  They are fond of nuts. They should be kept very clean, and allowed a
  bath frequently. When parrots appear sickly in any way, it is best to
  keep them warm, change their food for a time, and give them lukewarm

  Rabbits should be kept dry and warm.  Their best food is celery,
  parsley, and carrots; but they will eat almost any kind of vegetable,
  especially the dandelion, milk-thistle, &amp;c. In spring it is
  recommended to give them tares. A little bran, and any kind of grain
  occasionally is beneficial, as too much green food is very hurtful.
  Care should be taken not to over-feed them. When fed upon dry food a
  little skim milk is good for them. Tea leaves also, in small
  quantities, may be given to them.

  Fresh river-water should be given them frequently, if possible.
  Gold-fish seldom deposit spawn when kept in glass-vessels. In order to

The distemper is liable to attack dogs from four months to four years
  old. It prevails most in spring and autumn. The disease is known by
  dulness of the eye, husky cough, shivering, loss of appetite and
  spirits, and fits. When fits occur, the dog will most likely die,
  unless a veterinary surgeon be called in. During the distemper, dogs
  should be allowed to run on the grass; their diet should be spare; and
  a little sulphur be placed in their water.  Chemists who dispense
  cattle medicines can generally advise with sufficient safety upon the
  diseases of dugs, and it is best for unskilful persons to abstain from
  physicing them.  In many diseases dogs will be benefited by warm baths.

<br>
  Hydrophobia is the most dreadful of all diseases. The first symptoms
  are attended by thirst, fever, and languor. The dog starts
  convulsively in his sleep, and when awake, though restless, is
  languid. When a dog is suspected, he should he firmly chained in a
  place where neither children nor dogs nor cats can get near him. Any
  one going to attend him should wear thick leather gloves, and proceed
  with great caution. When a dog snaps savagely at an imaginary object,
  it is almost a certain indication of madness; and when it exhibits a
  terror of fluids, it is confirmed hydrophobia. Some dogs exhibit a
  great dislike of musical sounds, and when this is the case they are
  too frequently made sport of. But it is a dangerous sport, as dogs
  have sometimes been driven mad by it.

<br>
  It is generally supposed that cats are more attached to places than to
  individuals, but this is an error. They obstinately cling to certain
  places, because it is there they expect to see the persons to whom
  they are attached. A cat will return to an empty house, and remain in
  it many weeks. But when at last she finds that the family does not
  return, she strays away, and if she chance then to find the family,
  she will abide with them. The same rules of feeding which apply to
  dogs apply also to cats. They should not be over-fed, nor too
  frequently.  Cats are liable to the same diseases as dogs; though they
  do not become ill so frequently. A little brimstone in their milk
  occasionally is a good preventive. The veterinary chemist will also
  prescribe for the serious diseases of cats.

  No trait of character is more agreeable in a female than the

  It is sunshine falling on his heart. He is happy, and the cares of
  life are forgotten. A sweet temper has a soothing influence over the
  minds of a whole family. Where it is found in the wife and mother, you
  observe a kindness and love predominating over the natural feelings of
  a bad heart. Smiles, kind words and looks, characterize the children,
  and peace and love have their dwelling there. Study, then, to acquire

  Mothers who wish not only to discharge well their own duties in the
  domestic circle, but to train up their daughters for a later day to
  make happy and comfortable firesides for their families, should watch
  well, and guard well, the notions which they imbibe and with which
  they grow up. There will be many persons ready to fill their young
  heads with false and vain fancies, and there is so much always afloat
  in society opposed to duty and common sense, that if mothers do not
  watch well, their children may contract ideas very fatal to their
  future happiness and usefulness, and hold them till they grow into
  habits of thought or feeling. A wise mother will have her eyes open,
  and be ready for every emergency. A few words of common, downright
  practical sense, timely uttered by her, may be enough to counteract
  some foolish idea or belief put into her daughter's head by others,
  whilst if it be left unchecked, it may take such possession of the
  mind that it cannot be corrected at a later time.<br>
<br>
  One false notion rife in the present age is the idea that women,
  unless compelled to it by absolute poverty, are out of place when
  engaged in domestic affairs. Now mothers should have a care lest their
  daughters get hold of this conviction as regard themselves&mdash;there is
  danger of it; the fashion of the day engenders it, and even the care
  that an affectionate family take to keep a girl, during the time of
  her education, free from other occupations than those of her tasks, or
  her recreations, may lead her to infer that the matters with which she
  is never asked to concern herself are, in fact, no concern to her, and
  that any attention she may ever bestow on them is not a matter of
  simple duty, but of grace, or concession, or stooping, on her part.
  Let mothers bring up their daughters from the <i>first</i> with the idea
  that in this world it is required to give as well as to receive, to
  minister as well as to enjoy; that every person is bound to be useful
  in his own sphere, and that a woman's first sphere is the house, and
  its concerns and demands. Once really imbued with this belief, a young
  girl will usually be anxious to learn all that her mother is disposed
  to teach, and will be proud and happy to aid in any domestic
  occupations assigned to her. These need never be made so heavy as to
  interfere with the peculiar duties or enjoyments of her age. If a
  mother wishes to see her daughter become a good, happy, and rational
  woman, never let there be contempt for domestic occupations, or suffer
  them to be deemed secondary.

  delights in enterprise and action; but to sustain him he needs a

<a name="p2193"></a><b><i>2193. &nbsp;Hints for Husbands (2)</i></b><br>
<br>
You can hardly imagine how refreshing it is to occasionally call up
  the recollection of your courting days. How tediously the hours rolled
  away prior to the appointed time of meeting; how swiftly they seemed
  to fly when you had met; how fond was the first greeting; how tender
  the last embrace; how vivid your dreams of future happiness, when,
  returning to your home, you felt yourself secure in the confessed love
  of the object of your warm affections! Is your dream realised?&mdash;are
  you as happy as you expected? Consider whether, as a husband, you are
  as fervent and constant as you were when a lover. Remember that the
  wife's claims to your unremitting regard, great before marriage, are
  now exalted to a much higher degree. She has left the world for
  you&mdash;the home of her childhood, the fireside of her parents, their
  watchful care and sweet intercourse have all been yielded up for you.
  Look, then, most jealously upon all that may tend to attract you from
  home, and to weaken that union upon which your temporal happiness
  mainly depends; and believe that in the solemn relationship of husband
  is to be found one of the best guarantees for man's honour and
  happiness.

<br>
Perchance you think that your husband's disposition is much changed;
  that he is no longer the sweet-tempered, ardent lover he used to be.
  This may be a mistake. Consider his struggles with the world&mdash;his
  everlasting race with the busy competition of trade. What is it makes
  him so eager in the pursuit of gain&mdash;so energetic by day, so sleepless
  by night&mdash;but his love of home, wife, and children, and a dread that
  their respectability, according to the light in which he has conceived
  it, may be encroached upon by the strife of existence? This is the
  true secret of that silent care which preys upon the hearts of many
  men, and true it is, that when love is least apparent, it is
  nevertheless the active principle which animates the heart, though
  fears and disappointments make up a cloud which obscures the warmer
  element. As above the clouds there is glorious sunshine, while below
  are showers and gloom, so with the conduct of man&mdash;behind the gloom of
  anxiety is a bright fountain of high and noble feeling. Think of this
  in those moments when clouds seem to lower upon your domestic peace,
  and, by tempering your conduct accordingly, the gloom will soon pass
  away, and warmth and brightness take its place.

<br>
Summer is the season of love and innocent enjoyment. What shall the
  husband do when summer returns to gladden the earth, and all who live
  upon it? Must he still pore over the calculations of the
  counting-house, or ceaselessly pursue the toils of the
  work-room&mdash;sparing no moment to taste the joys which Heaven measures
  out so liberally? No! Let him ask his wife once more to breathe with
  him the fresh air of heaven, and look upon the beauties of earth. The
  summers are few that they may dwell together; so let him not give them
  all to Mammon, but seek invigorating and health-renewing recreation
  abroad, which shall make the hearts of each glow with emotions of
  renewed love.

<br>
"It was!" "It was not!" "It <i>was!</i>" "It was <i>not</i>!" "Ah!" "Ha!"&mdash;Now
  who's the wiser or the better for this contention for the last word?
  Does obstinacy establish superiority or elicit truth? Decidedly not!
  Woman has always been described as clamouring for the last word, and
  men, generally, have agreed in attributing this trait to her, and in
  censuring her for it. This being so it remains for some one of the
  sex, by an exhibition of noble example, to aid in sweeping away the
  unpleasant imputation. The wife who will establish the rule of
  allowing her husband to have the last word, will achieve for herself
  and her sex a great moral victory! Is he <i>right</i>?&mdash;it were a great
  error to oppose him. Is he <i>wrong</i>?&mdash;he will soon discover it, and
  applaud the self-command which bore unvexed his pertinacity. And
  gradually there will spring up such a happy fusion of feelings and
  ideas, that there will be no "last word" to contend about, but a
  steady and unruffled flow of generous sentiment.

<a name="p2197"></a><b><i>2197. &nbsp;Cider</i></b><br>
<br>
  A beverage made from the juice of the apple, and for which sour and
  rough-tasted apples are generally preferred. The process of making
  cider varies in different localities, but in every case essentially
  consists of the collection of the fruit, and the expression and
  fermentation of the juice. The <i>collection of the fruit</i> should not be
  commenced before it has become sufficiently mature. The apples, after
  being gathered, are usually left for fourteen or fifteen days in a
  barn or loft to mellow, during which time the mucilage is decomposed,
  and alcohol and carbonic acid developed.<br>
<br>
  The <i>expression of the juice</i> is the next step in cider-making. The
  apples are ground to a pulp in a mill, consisting of two fluted
  cylinders of hard wood or cast iron working against each other. The
  pulp is afterwards put into coarse strong bags, and pressed with a
  heavy weight so as to squeeze out all the juice. This is then placed
  in large open tubs, and kept at a heat of about sixty degrees. After
  two or three days for weak cider, and eight or ten days for strong
  cider, or as soon as the sediment has subsided, the liquor is drawn
  off into clean casks. The casks are then stored in a cellar, shaded
  barn, or other cool place, where a low and regular temperature can be
  insured, and are left to mature and ripen until the following spring.
  The refuse pulp may be given to pigs and store cattle.

<a name="p2198"></a><b><i>2198. &nbsp;Bottling Cider</i></b><br>
<br>
Preparatory to <i>bottling cider</i>, it should always be examined, to see
  whether it is clear and sparkling. If not so, it should be clarified,
  and left for a fortnight. The night previous to bottling, the bung
  should be taken out of the cask, and the filled bottles should not be
  corked down until the day after; as, if this is done at once, many of
  the bottles will burst by keeping. The best corks should be used.
  Champagne bottles are the best for cider.  When the cider is wanted
  for immediate use, or for consumption during the cooler season of the
  year, a small piece of lump sugar may be put into each bottle before
  corking it. When intended for keeping, it should be stored in a cool
  cellar, when the quality will be greatly improved by age.

<br>
Cider, eighteen gallons; spirit, three pints; sugar, five pounds. Mix

  milk. Bottle in champagne bottles: when opened, it will be found to

<a name="p2200"></a><b><i>2200. &nbsp;Properties of Cider</i></b><br>
<br>
Cider is a pleasant and refreshing beverage, and with persons in good
  health is not unwholesome when drunk in moderation. By persons
  suffering from indigestion, however, it should be carefully avoided;
  nor should it be drunk by persons when they are overheated, as it is
  apt to cause colic and other disagreeable symptoms. Persons who suffer
  from rheumatism, or have a tendency to it should not drink cider.

<a name="p2201"></a><b><i>2201. &nbsp;Perry</i></b><br>
<br>
  A beverage made from pears. The fruit used for this purpose should
  contain a large proportion of sugar, and be likewise astringent, or
  the liquor from it will be acetous when it ceases to be saccharine. In
  the making of perry, the pears are pressed and ground in precisely the
  same manner as apples are in the making of cider. The method of
  fermenting perry is nearly the same as that for cider; but the former
  does not afford the same indications as the latter by which the proper
  period of racking off may be known. The thick scum that collects on
  the surface of cider rarely appears in the juice of the pear, and
  during the time of the suspension of its fermentation, the excessive
  brightness of the former liquor is seldom seen in the latter; but when
  the fruit has been regularly ripe, its produce will generally become
  moderately clear and quiet in a few days after it is made, and it
  should then be drawn off from its grosser lees.<br>
<br>
  In the after management of perry the process is the same as that of
  cider; but it does not so well bear situations where it is much
  exposed to change of temperature. In bottle it almost always retains
  its good qualities, and in that situation it is always advisable to
  put it, if it remain sound and perfect at the conclusion of the first
  succeeding summer.

<a name="p2202"></a><b><i>2202. &nbsp;Servants</i></b><br>
<br>
  There are frequent complaints in these days, that servants are bad,
  and dependents and aiding hands generally are bad. It may be so. But
  if it is so, what is the inference? In the working of the machine of
  society, class moves pretty much with class; that is, one class moves
  pretty much with its equals in the community (equals so far as social
  station is concerned), and apart from other classes, as much those
  below as those above itself; but there is one grand exception to this
  general rule, and that is, in the case of domestic servants. The same
  holds, though in less degree, with assistants; and in less degree
  only; because in this last case, the difference of grade is slighter.<br>
<br>
  Domestic servants, and assistants in business and trade, come most
  closely and continually into contact with their employers; and they
  are about them from morning till night, and see them in every phase of
  character, in every style of humour, in every act of life. How
  powerful is the force of example! Rectitude is promoted, not only by
  precept but by example, and, so to speak, by contact it is increased
  more widely. Kindness is communicated in the same way. Virtue of every
  kind acts like an electric shock. Those who come under its influence
  imbibe its principles. The same with qualities and tempers that do no
  honour to our nature. If servants come to you bad, you may at least
  improve them; possibly almost change their nature. Here follows, then,
  a receipt to that effect:<br>
<br>
  <i>Receipt for obtaining good servants</i>.&mdash;Let them observe in your
  conduct to others just the qualities and virtues that you would desire
  they should possess and practise as respects you. Be uniformly kind
  and gentle. If you reprove, do so with reason and with good temper. Be
  respectable, and you will be respected by them. Be kind, and you will
  meet kindness from them. Consider their interests, and they will
  consider yours. A friend in a servant is no contemptible thing. Be to
  every servant a friend; and heartless, indeed, will be the servant who
  does not warm in love to you.

  for six days, frequently beating and mashing them. By this time the
  shells become soft and pulpy, then by banking the mass up on one side
  of the tub, and at the same time raising the tub on that side, the
  liquor will drain clear off to the other; then take that liquor out:
  the mashing and banking-up may be repeated as often as liquor is
  found. The quantity obtained will be about six quarts. When done, let
  it be simmered in an iron boiler as long as any scum arises; then
  bruise a quarter of a pound of ginger, a quarter of a pound of
  allspice, two ounces of long pepper, and two ounces of cloves. Let it
  slowly boil for half an hour with the above ingredients; when bottled,
  let an equal quantity of the spice go into each bottle. Before
  corking, let the bottles be filled quite up: cork them tight, seal
  them over, and put them into a cool and dry place for one year before
  they are used.

  preferable to any of the ketchups containing spice, &amp;c., to preserve
  them, which overpowers the flavour of the mushrooms. An artificial

   <blockquote> "We advise all who are fond of cayenne not to think it too much
    trouble to make it of English chilis,&mdash;there is no other way of
    being sure it is genuine,&mdash;and they will obtain a pepper of much
    finer flavour, without half the heat of the foreign. A hundred large
    chilis, costing only two shillings, will produce you about two
    ounces of cayenne,&mdash;so it is as cheap as the commonest cayenne. Four
    hundred chilis, when the stems were taken off, weighed half a pound;
    and when dried produced a quarter of a pound of cayenne pepper. The
    following is the way to make it:&mdash;Take away the stalks, and put the
    pods into a cullender; set them before the fire,&mdash;they will take
    full twelve hours to dry;&mdash;then put them into a mortar, with
    one-fourth their weight of salt, and pound them and rub them till

Three dozen of natives require seven
  ounces and a half of flour to make them into a paste weighing eleven
  ounces, which, when dried, is reduced to six and a half ounces. To
  make half a pint of sauce, put one ounce of butter into a stewpan with
  three drachms of oyster powder, and six tablespoonfuls of milk; set it
  on a slow fire, stir it till it boils, and season it with salt. As a
  sauce, it is excellent for fish, fowls, or rump steaks. Sprinkled on
  bread and butter, it makes a good sandwich.

  let it get slightly browned (but <i>take care it is not at all burnt</i>):
  then pour in a pint-and-a-half of boiling water, set the pan on the

  stewpan close, let it <i>stew very gently</i> for about two hours, then
  strain it through a sieve into a basin.<br>

  If you wish to thicken it, set a clean stewpan over a slow fire, with
  about an ounce of butter in it; when it is melted, dredge into it (by
  degrees) as much flour as will dry it up, stirring them intimately;

<br>
  It is well known that a loose and easy dress contributes much to give
  the sex the fine proportions of body that are observable in the
  Grecian statues, and which serve as models to our present artists,
  nature being too much disfigured among us to afford any such. The
  Greeks knew nothing of those ligatures and bandages with which our
  bodies are compressed. Their women were ignorant of the use of stays,
  by which ours distort their shape instead of displaying it. This
  practice, carried to excess as it is in England, is in bad taste. To
  behold a woman cut in two in the middle, as if she were like a wasp,
  is as shocking to the eye as it is painful to the imagination. Such a
  deformity would be shocking in a naked figure; wherefore, then, should
  it be esteemed a beauty in one that is dressed? Everything that
  confines and lays nature under restraint is an instance of bad taste.
  This is as true in regard to the ornaments of the body as to the
  embellishments of the mind. Life, health, reason, and convenience
  ought to be taken first into consideration. Gracefulness cannot
  subsist without ease.

<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
 Should you get caught in a shower, always remember to brush your
    hat well while wet. When dry, brush the glaze out, and gently iron
    it over with a smooth flat iron.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

     If your hat is <b>very</b> wet, or stained with <i>sea</i> water, get a
    basin of clean cold water, and a good stiff brush; wash it well all
    over, but be careful to keep the nap straight; brush it as dry as
    you can, then put it on a peg to dry.  When dry, brush the glaze
    out, and gently iron it over as above.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Should you get a spot of grease on your hat, just drop one drop
    of benzine or sapine on the place, and then rub it briskly with a
    piece of cloth until out.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Should you be travelling, always tie your hat up in a
    handkerchief before putting it into your case; this will save it
    from getting rubbed or damaged through the friction of the rail or
    steamboat.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

     Never put your hat flat on the brim, as it will spoil its shape;
    but always hung it up on a peg.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    Never put your hat, wet or dry, in front of the fire, as it will
    soften it, and throw it all out of shape.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    Before putting your hat down, be careful to see if the place is
    free from spots of grease, beer, sugar, &amp;c., as these things often
    spoil a good hat more than a twelvemonths' wear, and are often very
    difficult to remove.</li></ol><br>
<br>
  These simple rules will save a good hat for a very long time.

<br>
  Nothing looks worse than shabby gloves; and, as they are expensive
  articles in dress, they require a little management. A good glove will
  outlast six cheap ones with care. Do not wear your best gloves at
  night, the heat of the gas, &amp;c., gives a moisture to the hands, that
  spoils the gloves; do not wear them in very wet weather; as carrying
  umbrellas, and drops of rain, spoil them.

Make a strong lather with curd soap and warm water, in which steep a
  small piece of new flannel. Place the glove on a flat, clean, and
  unyielding surface &mdash;such as the bottom of a dish, and having
  thoroughly soaped the flannel (when squeezed from the lather), rub the
  kid till all dirt be removed, cleaning and re-soaping the flannel
  from time to time. Care must be taken to omit no part of the glove, by
  turning the fingers, &amp;c. The glove must be dried in the sun, or before
  a moderate fire, and will present the appearance of old parchment.
  When quite dry, they must be gradually "pulled out," and will look new.

  the cloth, spread out the glove smooth and neat. Take a piece of
  flannel, dip it in the milk, then rub off a good quantity of soap to
  the wetted flannel, and commence to rub the glove downwards towards
  the fingers, holding it firmly with the left hand. Continue this
  process until the glove, if white, looks of a dingy yellow, though
  clean; if coloured, till it looks dark and spoiled. Lay it to dry; and

<a name="p2254"></a><b><i>2254. &nbsp;Preserving the Colour of Dresses</i></b><br>
<br>
  The colours of merinos, mousseline-de-laines, ginghams, chintzes,
  printed lawns, &amp;c., may be preserved by using water that is only milk
  warm; making a lather with white soap, <i>before</i> you put in the dress,
  instead of rubbing it on the material; and stirring into a first and
  second tub of water a large tablespoonful of oxgall. The gall can be
  obtained from the butcher, and a bottle of it should always be kept in
  every house. No coloured articles should be allowed to remain long in
  the water. They must be washed fast, and then rinsed through two cold
  waters. In each, rinsing water stir a teaspoonful of vinegar, which
  will help to brighten the colours; and after rinsing, hang them out
  immediately. When <i>ironing-dry</i> (or still a little damp), bring them
  in; have irons ready heated, and iron them at once&mdash;as it injures the
  colours to allow them to remain damp too long&mdash;or sprinkle and roll
  them up in a cover for ironing next day. If they cannot be
  conveniently ironed immediately, let them hang till they are <i>quite</i>
  dry, and then damp and fold them on the, <i>following day,</i> a quarter of
  an hour before ironing.<br>
<br>
  It is better not to do coloured dresses on the day of the general
  wash, but to give them a morning by themselves. They should only be
  undertaken in clear bright weather. If allowed to freeze, the colours
  will be irreparably injured. We need scarcely say that no coloured
  articles should ever be boiled or scalded. If you get from a shop a
  slip for testing the durability of colours, give it a fair trial by
  washing it as above; afterwards pinning it to the edge of a towel, and
  hanging it to dry. Some colours (especially pinks and light greens),
  though they may stand perfectly well in washing, will change as soon
  as a warm iron is applied to them; the pink turning purplish, and the
  green bluish. No coloured article should be smoothed with a <i>hot</i>
  iron.

  are persons who have worked in brewing establishments, or in
  gentlemen's families where they have superintended the operations of
  the brew-house, and the aid of such persons would be valuable. With
  such assistance, the following receipts will be of importance, since
  many who are able to go through the manipulations of brewing are

  a brisk beverage like champagne; but neither rhubarb, currants, nor
  gooseberries will produce a wine with the true champagne flavour; it
  is to be obtained only from the fruit of the grape, ripe or unripe,
  its leaves, tops, and tendrils.  The following receipt will do for
  rhubarb, or any of the above-mentioned fruits.
<br>

<a name="p2274"></a><b><i>2274. &nbsp;English Champagne</i></b><br>
<br>
  Take fifty pounds of rhubarb and thirty-seven pounds of fine moist
  sugar. Provide a tub that will hold from fifteen to twenty gallons,
  taking care that it has a hole for a tap near the bottom. In this tub
  bruise the rhubarb; when done, add four gallons of water; let the
  whole be well stirred together; cover the tub with a cloth or blanket,
  and let the materials stand for twenty-four hours; then draw off the
  liquor through the tap; add one or two more gallons of water to the
  pulp, let it be well stirred, and then allowed to remain an hour or
  two to settle, then draw off; mix the two liquors together, and in it
  dissolve the sugar.<br>
<br>
  Let the tub be made clean, and return the liquor to it, cover it with
  a blanket, and place it in a room the temperature of which is not
  below 60° Fahr.; here it is to remain for twenty-four, forty-eight, or
  more hours, until there is an appearance of fermentation having begun,
  when it should be drawn off into the ten-gallon cask, as fine as
  possible, which cask must be filled up to the bung-hole with water, if
  there is not liquor enough; let it lean to one side a little, that it
  may discharge itself; if there is any liquor left in the tub not quite
  fine, pass it through flannel, and fill up with that instead of water.<br>
<br>
  As the fermentation proceeds and the liquor diminishes, it must be
  filled up daily, to encourage the fermentation, for ten or twelve
  days; it then becomes more moderate, when the bung should be put in,
  and a gimlet hole made at the side of it, fitted with a spile; this
  spile should be taken out every two or three days, according to the
  state of the fermentation, for eight or ten days, to allow some of the
  carbonic acid gas to escape. When this state is passed, the cask may
  he kept full by pouring a little liquor in at the vent-hole once a
  week or ten days, for three or four weeks.<br>
<br>
  This operation is performed at long intervals, of a month or more,
  till the end of December, when on a fine frosty day it should be drawn
  off from the lees as fine as possible; and the turbid part passed
  through flannel. Make the cask clean, return the liquor to it, with
  one drachm of isinglass (pure) dissolved in a little water; stir the
  whole together, and put the bung in firmly.<br>
<br>
  Choose a clear dry day in March for bottling. The bottles should be
  champagne bottles&mdash;common wine bottles are not strong enough; secure
  the corks in a proper manner with wire, &amp;c. The liquor is generally
  made up to two or three pints over the ten gallons, which is bottled
  for the purpose of filling the cask as it is wanted. The wine contains
  spirit enough without the addition of brandy, which spoils all wines;
  a proper fermentation producing spirit enough.<br>
<br>
  The way to obtain a dry wine from these materials is to keep the cask
  constantly filled up to the bung-hole, daily or every other day, as
  long as any fermentation is perceptible by applying the ear near to
  the hole; the bung may then be put in lightly for a time, before
  finally fixing it; it may be racked off on a fine day in December, and
  fined with isinglass as above directed, and bottled in March.

Take your pocket handkerchief, and laying it out the full square,
  double down <i>one-third</i> over the other part. Then raise the whole and
  turn it over, so that the third folded down shall now be underneath.
  Take hold of one of the folded corners, and draw its point towards the
  centre; then do the same with the other, as in making a cocked-hat, or
  a boat, of paper. Then take hold of the two remaining corners, and
  twisting the hem of the handkerchief, continue to roll it until it
  meets the double corners brought to the centre, and catches them up a

  The Turkish way of making coffee produces a very different result from
  that to which we are accustomed. A small conical saucepan something
  like our beer-warmer, with a long handle, and calculated to hold about
  two tablespoonfuls of water, is the vessel used. The fresh roasted
  berry is pounded, not ground, and about a dessertspoonful is put into
  the minute boiler; it is then nearly filled with water, and thrust
  among the embers. A few seconds suffice to make it boil, and the
  decoction, grounds and all, is poured out into a small cup, which fits
  into a brass socket, much like the cup of an acorn, and holding the
  china cup as that does the acorn itself. The Turks seem to drink this
  decoction boiling, and swallow the grounds with the liquid. We allow
  it to remain a minute, in order to leave the sediment at the bottom. 
  It is always taken plain; sugar or cream would be thought to spoil it;
  and Europeans, after a little practice, are said to prefer it to the
  clear infusion drunk in France. In every hut these coffee boilers may
  be seen suspended, and the means for pounding the roasted berry are
  always at hand.

<br>
A few grains added to the tea before the water is poured on it greatly
  improves the flavour of the infusion.  When used instead of soda, or
  carbonate of soda, in cooking vegetables, such as greens, peas, beans,
  &amp;c., it improves their flavour, preserves their colour, and renders
  them tender. Vegetables, eaten in an uncooked state, as, salad, are
  rendered more crisp and of better flavour, by steeping them for a
  short time before they are brought to table in a solution of borax.

  Meat may be preserved, and taint removed by soaking it for a short
  time in a solution of Patent Californian Borax, or by sprinkling it
  with the dry powder.  Game, poultry, hams, bacon, and all kinds of
  meat may be thus preserved. Milk cans should be washed with the
  solution, and milk itself may be preserved and kept sweet for some
  time by adding to each quart about half a thimbleful of this prepared
  borax dissolved in a tablespoonful of hot water. Butter may also be
  preserved by washing it in a solution of borax, or sprinkling the

  anyone who is suffering from any infectious disorder. Flannels are
  rendered softer, and the appearance of lace, fine articles, coloured

  The leaves should be put into an earthen or glass vessel, and a large
  quantity of rain water poured over them; after this they must be left
  in the open air, and to the heat of the sun, without covering the
  vessel.  As the water evaporates and the leaves become dry, more water
  must be added; the leaves will by this means putrefy, but the time
  required for this varies; some plants will be finished in a month,
  others will require two months or longer, according to the toughness
  of their parenchyma.  When they have been in a state of putrefaction
  for some time, the two membranes will begin to separate, and the green
  part of the leaf to become fluid; then the operation of clearing is to
  be performed.<br>
<br>
  The leaf is to be put upon a flat white earthen plate, and covered
  with clear water; and being gently squeezed with the finger, the
  membranes will begin to open, and the green substance will come out at
  the edges; the membranes must be carefully taken off with the finger,
  and great caution must be used in separating them near the middle rib.
  When once there is an opening towards this separation, the whole
  membrane always follows easily; when both membranes are taken off, the
  skeleton is finished, and it has to be washed clean with water, and
  then dried between the leaves of a book.

  Fruits are divested of their pulp and made into skeletons in a

  soft, and not tough; let it be carefully pared without squeezing it,
  and without injuring either the crown or the stalk; put it into a pot
  of rain water, covered, set it over the fire, and let it boil gently
  till perfectly soft, then take it out and lay it in a dish filled with
  cold water; then holding it by the stalk with one hand, rub off as
  much of the pulp as you can with the finger and thumb, beginning at
  the stalk and rubbing it regularly towards the crown. The fibres are
  most tender towards the extremities, and are therefore to be treated
  with great care there. When the pulp has thus been cleared pretty well
  off, the point of a fine penknife may be of use to pick away the pulp
  sticking to the core. In order to see how the operation advances, the
  soiled water must be thrown away from time to time, and clean poured
  on in its place. When the pulp is in this manner perfectly separated,
  the clean skeleton is to be preserved in spirits of wine.

<br>
  This beautiful experiment can be performed by any person in possession
  of a common galvanic battery.  The process is as follows:<br>
<br>
  Soften a piece of gutta percha over a candle, or before a fire; knead
  it with the moist fingers upon a table, until the surface is perfectly
  smooth, and large enough to cover the leaf to be copied; lay the leaf
  flat upon the surface, and press every part well into the
  gutta-percha. In about five minutes the leaf may be removed, when, if
  the operation has been carefully performed, a perfect impression of
  the leaf will be made in the gutta percha.<br>
<br>
  This must now be attached to the wire in connection with the zinc end
  of the battery (which can easily be done by heating the end of the
  wire, and pressing it into the gutta percha), dusted well over with
  the best blacklead with a camel-hair brush&mdash;the object of which is to
  render it a conductor of electricity; it should then be completely
  immersed in a saturated solution of sulphate of copper. A piece of
  copper attached to the wire in connection with the copper end of the
  battery must also be inserted into the copper solution facing the
  gutta percha, but not touching it; this not only acts as a conductor
  to the electricity, but also maintains the solution of copper of a
  permanent strength.<br>
<br>
  In a short time the copper will be found to creep over the whole
  surface of the gutta percha, and in about twenty-four hours a thick
  deposit of copper will be obtained, which may then be detached from
  the mould. The accuracy with which a leaf may thus be cast is truly
  surprising.

  used for that purpose), after the ink is applied to it, should be
  pressed several times on a piece of leather, or some smooth surface,
  before each application to the leaf, that the ink may be smoothly and
  evenly applied. After the under surface of the leaf has been
  sufficiently inked, apply it to the paper where you wish the
  impression to be; and, after covering it with a slip of paper, use the
  hand or roller to press upon it.

  Hold oiled paper in the smoke of a lamp or of pitch, until it becomes
  coated with the smoke; to this paper apply the leaf of which you wish
  an impression, having previously warmed it between your hands, that it
  may he pliable. Place the lower surface of the leaf upon the blackened
  surface of the oil-paper, that the numerous veins, which are so
  prominent on this side, may receive from the paper a portion of the
  smoke. Lay a paper over the leaf, and then press it gently upon the
  smoked paper with the fingers, or with a small roller covered with
  woollen cloth, or some similarly soft material, so that every part of
  the leaf may come in contact with the sooted oil-paper. A coating of
  the smoke will adhere to the leaf. Then remove the leaf carefully, and
  place the blackened surface on a sheet of white paper, or in a book
  prepared for the purpose, covering the leaf with a clean slip of
  paper, and pressing upon it with the fingers, or roller, as before.<br>
<br>
  Thus may be obtained the impression of a leaf, showing the perfect
  outlines, together with an accurate exhibition of the veins which
  extend in every direction through it, more correctly than the finest
  drawing. And this process is so simple, and the materials so easily
  obtained, that any person, with a little practice to enable him to
  apply the right quantity of smoke to the oil-paper, and give the leaf
  a proper pressure, can prepare beautiful leaf impressions, such as a

<br>
  The plants to be preserved should be gathered when the weather is dry.
  Place the ends in water, and let them remain in a cool place till the
  next day. When about to be submitted to the process of drying, place
  each plant between several sheets of blotting paper, and iron it with
  a large smooth heater, pretty strongly warmed, till all the moisture
  is dissipated. Colours may thus be fixed, which otherwise become pale,
  or nearly white. Some plants require more moderate heat than others,
  and herein consists the nicety of the experiment; but it is generally
  found that if the iron be not too hot, and is passed rapidly yet
  carefully over the surface of the blotting paper, it answers the
  purpose equally well with plants of almost every variety of hue and
  thickness.<br>
<br>
  In compound flowers, with those also of a stubborn and solid form, as
  the Centaurea, some little art is required in cutting away the under
  part, by which means the profile and forms of the flowers will be more
  distinctly exhibited. This is especially necessary when the flowers
  are fixed down with gum upon the paper previous to ironing, by which
  means they become almost incorporated with the surface. When this very
  delicate process is attempted, blotting-paper should be laid under
  every part excepting the blossoms, in order to prevent staining the
  white paper. Great care must be taken to keep preserved specimens in a
  dry place.

"First wash the sea-weed in fresh water, then take a plate or dish
    (the larger the better), cut your paper to the size required, place
    it in the plate with fresh water, and spread out the plant with a
    good-sized camel-hair pencil in a natural form (picking out with the
    pin gives the sea-weed an unnatural appearance, and destroys the
    characteristic fall of the branches, which should be carefully
    avoided); then gently raise the paper with the specimen out of the
    water, placing it in a slanting position for a few moments, so as to
    allow the super-abundant water to ran off; after which, place it in
    the press. The press is made with either three pieces of board or
    pasteboard. Lay on the first board two sheets of blotting-paper; on
    that lay your specimens; place straight and smooth over them a piece
    of old muslin, fine cambric, or linen; then some more
    blotting-paper, and place another board on the top of that, and
    continue in the same way. <br>
<br>
    The blotting-paper and the muslin should
    be carefully removed and dried every day, and then replaced; at the
    same time, those specimens that are sufficiently dried may be taken
    away. Nothing now remains but to write on each the name, date, and
    locality. You can either gum the specimens in a scrap-book, or fix
    them in, as drawings are often fastened, by making four slits in the
    page, and inserting each corner. This is by far the best plan, as it
    admits of their removal, without injury to the page, at any future
    period, if it be required either to insert better specimens, or
    intermediate species. <br>
<br>
    Some of the large algae will not adhere to the

      algae over with spirits of turpentine, in which two or three small
      lumps of gum mastic have been dissolved, by shaking in a warm
      place; two-thirds of a small phial is the proper proportion, and
      this will make the specimens retain a fresh appearance.'"</blockquote>

  Take out the entrails, open a passage to the brain, which should be
  scooped out through the mouth; introduce into the cavities of the
  skull and the whole body, some of the mixture of salt, alum, and
  pepper, putting some through the gullet and whole length of the neck;
  then hang the bird in a cool, airy place&mdash;first by the feet, that the
  body may be impregnated by the salt, and afterwards by a thread
  through the under mandible of the bill, till it appears to be free
  from smell; then hang it in the sun, or near a fire: after it is well
  dried, clean out what remains loose of the mixture, and fill the
  cavity of the body with wood, oakum, or any soft substance, and pack
  it smooth in paper.

<a name="p2341"></a><b><i>2341. &nbsp;Birds' Eggs</i></b><br>
<br>
  In selecting eggs for a cabinet, always choose those which are newly
  laid; make a medium-sized hole at the sharp end with a pointed
  instrument, and one at the blunt end: let this last hole be as small
  as possible; this done, apply your mouth to the blunt end, and blow
  the contents through the sharp end. If the yolk will not come freely,
  run a pin or wire up into the egg, and stir the yolk well about; now
  get a cupful of water, and immersing the sharp end of the shell into
  it, apply your mouth to the blunt end and suck up some of the water
  into the empty shell; then put your finger and thumb upon the two
  holes, shake the water well within, and after this, blow it out. The
  water will clear the egg of any remains of yolk or of white which may
  stay in after blowing. If one injection of water will not suffice,
  make a second or third.<br>
<br>
  An egg, immediately after it is produced, is very clear and fine; but
  by staying in the nest, and coming in contact with the feet of the
  bird, it soon assumes a dirty appearance. To remedy this, wash it well
  in soap and water, and use a nail-brush to get the dirt off. The
  eggshell is now as it ought to be, and nothing remains to be done but
  to prevent the thin white membrane (which is still inside) from
  corrupting.<br>
<br>
  Take a wineglass and fill it with a solution of corrosive sublimate in
  alcohol, then immerse the sharp end of the eggshell into it, keeping
  the finger and thumb which hold the egg just clear of the solution.
  Apply the mouth to the little hole at the blunt end, and suck up some
  of the solution into the shell. There need be no fear of getting the
  liquor into the mouth, for as soon as it rises in the shell the cold
  will strike the finger and thumb, and then the sucking must be
  immediately discontinued. Shake the shell in the same manner as when
  the water was in it, and then blow the solution back into the glass.<br>
<br>
  The eggshell will now be beyond the reach of corruption; the membrane
  for ever retains its pristine whiteness, and no insect, for the time
  to come, will ever venture to prey upon it. If you wish your egg to
  appear extremely brilliant, give it a coat of mastic varnish, put on
  very sparingly with a camel-hair pencil: green or blue eggs must be
  done with gum arabic, as the mastic varnish is apt to injure the
  colour.

<br>
  Take two parts of stearine, two parts of Venetian soap, one part of
  pearlash, and twenty-four to thirty parts of a solution of caustic
  potash. The stearine and soap are cut into slices, mixed with the cold
  lye, and boiled for about half an hour, being constantly stirred.
  Whenever the mass rises, a little cold lye is added. The pearlash,
  previously moistened with a little rain water, is then added, and the
  whole boiled for a few minutes. The mass is then stirred until cold,
  when it is mixed with so much cold lye that it becomes perfectly
  liquid, and runs off the spoon without coagulating and contracting.
  Previously to using this composition, it should be kept for several
  days well covered.  It may be preserved for years.<br>
<br>
  Before applying it to the objects, they should be well dusted, the
  stains scraped away, and then coated, by means of a thick brush, with
  the wash, as long as the plaster of Paris absorbs it, and left to dry.
  The coating is then dusted with leather, or a soft brush. If the

  afterwards.

<a name="p2374"></a><b><i>2374. &nbsp;Cities and Temples</i></b><br>
<br>
  We will suppose that the model is to represent the Temple of Theseus
  at Athens, which was built by Cimon, the son of Miltiades. In the
  first place we must obtain the necessary dimensions, and then,
  reducing the number of feet to fractional parts of an inch, form a
  scale suitable for carrying out the whole. A piece of wood of the
  necessary size is procured, the plan marked out in pencil, and the
  ground on which it stands imitated in cork, by cutting away the parts
  that are not required with a sharp penknife, and adding others with
  glue.<br>
<br>
  The floor of the temple is now to be glued on with common glue, for we
  should remark that the liquid glue does not dry quickly enough for
  cork modelling, and is not so good as the old plan; the sides and ends
  are formed of cork sheets, marked with a lead pencil to represent the
  blocks of stone; and ruined and broken parts imitated, by pricking the
  cork with a blunt penknife or needle. The frieze, representing the
  battle between the Centaurs and Lapithæ and the metopes in
  mezzo-relievo, containing a mixture of the labours of Hercules and
  Theseus, should be drawn upon the sheets of cork according to scale,
  and coloured with a little lampblack and raw sienna, to represent the
  subject intended, if the scale is small; but if the model admits of
  it, the groups may be neatly carved with a sharp penknife from the
  cork, which has been previously outlined with pencil.<br>
<br>
  The next thing we shall have to do is to strengthen the interior of
  the model, and this is done by glueing small pieces of cork, at
  irregular intervals, at the angles formed by the junction of any
  parts; these are put on the inside, and lastly, the roof is affixed.
  Any parts that require to be coloured, may be touched up with varnish
  or water colours, and lichen, &amp;c., affixed with mucilage where it is
  requisite.

<br>
We will imagine that the reader desires to model the features of some
  friend, and as there is some difficulty in the matter, on account of
  the person operated upon having a natural tendency to distort the
  features when the liquid plaster is poured upon the face, and some
  danger of suffocation if the process is not well managed, we will
  proceed at once to describe the various stages of operating:

<a name="p2376"></a><b><i>2376. &nbsp;Procedure (1)</i></b><br>
<br>
Mix the plaster of paris with warm water, and have it about as thick
  as cream, but do not mix it until all is ready. Lay the person upon
  his back, and having raised his head to the natural position when
  walking, by means of a pillow of bran or sand, cover the parts
  intended to be cast with oil of almonds or olives, applied by means of
  a feather, brush, or lump of cotton: plug the ears with cotton or
  wool, and insert two quills into the nostrils, and plug the space
  between each quill and the nostril very carefully with cotton.

<a name="p2377"></a><b><i>2377. &nbsp;Procedure (2)</i></b><br>
<br>
Cover the face with the plaster, beginning at the upper part of the
  forehead, and spread it downwards over the eyes, which should be kept
  <i>firmly</i> closed, but not in such a manner as to produce any distortion
  by too violent compression&mdash;and continue the plaster as far as the
  lower border of the chin; cover that part of the chest and arms that
  is to be represented, and carry the plaster upwards, so as to join the
  cast of the face; then carefully remove each, and season for casting,
  by soaking or brushing with linseed oil boiled with sugar of lead or
  licharge. Some persons boil the moulds in the oil; and many, instead
  of casting the face in one piece, and the chest in another, lay
  threads across the face and up and down it, leaving the ends out. As
  the plaster sets, or is nearly set, the threads are pulled through, so
  as to divide the cast into four, five, or more pieces.

<a name="p2378"></a><b><i>2378. &nbsp;Procedure (3)</i></b><br>
<br>
The back part of the head is moulded by having an oval trencher sort
  of vessel, deeper than half the head, and generally made of plaster,
  and boiled in oil. The back of the head being oiled, and this trencher
  partially filled with liquid plaster of Paris, the head is lowered
  into it, and the cast taken. The back of the neck is cast with the
  person turned over on his face.

<a name="p2379"></a><b><i>2379. &nbsp;Procedure (4)</i></b><br>
<br>
  Each part of the mould is marked so as to secure accurate junction
  with the adjoining part or parts; sometimes with a <b>x</b> or <b>||</b>, which,
  passing over the junction of two pieces, serves to distinguish them.

<a name="p2380"></a><b><i>2380. &nbsp;Procedure (5)</i></b><br>
<br>
  To model the face, join the several pieces, and tie them together with
  twine; then wrap some rag round the joints, to prevent the plaster
  oozing out, and pour in the plaster, made tolerably fluid, taking care
  to oil the inside of the mould very carefully first. When the outer
  part of the mould is nearly set, scoop out the centre with a spoon,
  and let the whole dry; then remove the strings, &amp;c., and smooth off
  the edges of the joints upon the model with a sharp penknife, and
  carve out the eyes from the mass, otherwise they will appear as if
  closed.

<a name="p2381"></a><b><i>2381. &nbsp;Wax Models</i></b><br>
<br>
  Wax models may be made from the moulds used for the plaster; but when
  the wax sets at the outside to about one-eighth of an inch, the rest
  should be poured out of the mould; or, a smaller portion being poured
  in, it may be shaken about the inside of the mould until it is coated.
  The pieces are removed, and the seams trimmed up, as in the plaster
  cast.

<br>
  If a cast be made in Gutta Percha from the model in plaster&mdash;or, what
  is still better, in fusible metal,&mdash;then, by pressing basil leather,
  moistened with water, into the mould, and strengthening the back and
  centre with chips of wood affixed by liquid glue, a very nice model
  may be obtained in leather, which, when varnished, will look like oak
  carving&mdash;especially if it be stained with Stephens's Oak Stain.

  round the wire previously warmed, and gently heated over a spirit
  lamp, or dipped again into hot water, so as to allow the various parts
  to be covered with it. When the model is finished, it should be
  touched up here and there with oil colours&mdash;green, yellow, sienna, and
  Venetian red&mdash;according to fancy, and the effect produced will be very

<br>
  The sting of a bee is generally more virulent than that of a wasp, and
  with some people attended with very violent effects. The sting of a
  bee is barbed at the end, and is consequently always left in the
  wound; that of a wasp is pointed only, so that the latter insect can
  sting more than once, which a bee cannot do. When stung by a bee, let
  the sting be instantly pulled out; for the longer it remains in the
  wound, the deeper it will pierce, owing to its peculiar form, and emit
  more of the poison. The sting is hollow, and the poison flows through
  it, which is the sole cause of the pain and inflammation. The pulling
  out of the sting should he done carefully, and with a steady hand; for
  if any part of it breaks in, all remedies then, in a great, measure,
  will be ineffectual. When the sting is extracted, suck the wounded
  part, if possible, and very little inflammation, if any, will ensue.
  If hartshorn drops are immediately afterwards rubbed on the part, the
  cure will be more complete.

    home, which produced consternation among the cats. One of them I
    took up, to effect a reconciliation between her and the dog. In her
    terror, she bit me so severely on the first finger of the left hand,
    as not only to cause four of the teeth of her lower jaw to enter the
    flesh, but so agonizing was her bite that the pressure of her palate
    caused the finger to swell at the joint on the opposite side to
    where the lower teeth entered the finger. In a minute or two the
    pain was about as excruciating as anything I ever felt&mdash;certainly
    greater than I have suffered from a wound. I got some tincture of
    arnica, diluted with about twelve times the quantity of water, and
    proceeded to bathe the finger well with it. In about half a minute
    the blood began to flow freely, the pain ceased, and the swelling
    abated, and up to this moment I have had no further inconvenience or
    pain, not even soreness."</blockquote>

<br>
  Of all applications for a burn, there are none equal to a simple
  covering of common <i>wheat flour</i>. This is always at hand; and while it
  requires no skill in using, it produces most astonishing effects. The
  moisture produced upon the surface of a slight or deep burn is at once
  absorbed by the flour, and forms a paste which shuts out the air. As
  long as the fluid matters continue flowing, they are absorbed, and
  prevented from producing irritation, as they would do if kept from
  passing off by oily or resinous applications, while the greater the
  amount of those absorbed by the flour, the thicker the protective
  covering. Another advantage of the flour covering is, that next to the
  surface it is kept moist and flexible. It can also be readily washed
  off, without further irritation in removing. It may occasionally be
  washed off very carefully, when the crust that it forms has become
  dry, and a new covering be sprinkled on.

<br>
  The following is a simple process that has been adopted most
  successfully, not only in cases of small pox, in which it completely
  prevented pitting, but in all eruptive diseases generally, such as
  measles, scarlatina, nettlerash, chicken pox, &amp;c., relieving the
  itching, tingling, and irritation of those complaints, and thereby
  affording great relief, especially in the case of children. It
  consists in smearing the whole surface of the body, after the eruption
  is fairly out, with bacon fat; and the simplest way of employing it is
  to boil thoroughly a small piece of bacon with the skin on, and when
  cold to cut off the skin with the fat adhering to it, which is to be
  scored crosswise with a knife, and then gently rubbed over the surface
  once, twice, or thrice a day, according to the extent of the eruption
  and the recurrence of itching and irritation.<br>
<br>
  Another plan, practised by Dr. Allshorn, of Edinburgh, is to mix three
  parts of oil with one of white wax, by heat, and while warm and fluid
  to paint over the face and neck with a camel-hair brush. As this cools
  and hardens it forms a mask, which effectually excludes the air, and
  prevents pitting. It is said that if light is admitted into the
  patient's room through yellow blinds, so that the red and blue rays of
  the sun are excluded, pitting will be prevented.

<a name="p2443"></a><b><i>2443. &nbsp;Teething</i></b><br>
<br>
  Young children, whilst cutting their first set of teeth, often suffer
  severe constitutional disturbance. At first there is restlessness and
  peevishness, with slight fever, but not unfrequently these are
  followed by convulsive fits, as they are commonly called, which are
  caused by the brain becoming irritated; and sometimes under this
  condition the child is either cut off suddenly, or the foundation of
  serious mischief to the brain is laid.<br>
<br>
  The remedy, or rather the safeguard against these frightful
  consequences, is trifling, safe, and almost certain, and consists
  merely in lancing the gum covering the tooth which is making its way
  through. When teething is about it may be known by the spittle
  constantly drivelling from the mouth and wetting the frock. The child
  has its fingers often in its mouth, and bites hard any substance it
  can get hold of. If the gums be carefully looked at, the part where
  the tooth is pressing up is swollen and redder than usual; and if the
  finger be pressed on it the child shrinks and cries, showing that the
  gum is tender.<br>
<br>
  When these symptoms occur, the gum should be lanced, and sometimes the
  tooth comes through the next day, if near the surface; but if not so
  far advanced the cut heals and a scar forms, which is thought by some
  objectionable, as rendering the passage of the tooth more difficult.
  This, however, is not so, for the scar will give way much more easily
  than the uncut gum. If the tooth do not come through after two or
  three days, the lancing may be repeated; and this is more especially
  needed if the child be very fractious, and seems in much pain.<br>
<br>
  Lancing the gums is further advantageous, because it empties the
  inflamed part of its blood, and so relieves the pain and inflammation.
  The relief children experience in the course of two or three hours
  from the operation is often very remarkable, as they almost
  immediately become lively and cheerful.

  A sheet of finely perforated zinc, substituted for a pane of glass in

  form of ventilator; there should not be a bedroom without it.

<br>
  Get a piece of deal two inches wide and one inch thick, and as long as
  the width of the sashes of the window in which it is to be used. Care
  should be taken to ascertain the width of the sashes exactly, which
  may be done by measuring along the top of the lower sash, from one
  side of the sash frame to the other.  Raise the lower sash&mdash;drop in
  the piece of wood, so that it rests on the bottom part of the window
  frame, the ends being within the stops on either side, and then close
  the sash upon it. If properly planed up, no draught can enter between
  the wood and the bottom of the sash; but the air can enter the room in
  an upward direction, through the opening between the top of the lower
  sash and the bottom of the upper sash, any direct draught into the
  interior of the room being prevented by the position of the lower sash.

<br>
  The perfection of dress, for day or night, where warmth is the
  purpose, is that which confines around the body sufficient of its own
  warmth, while it allows escape to the exhalations of the skin. Where
  the body is allowed to bathe protractedly in its own vapours we must
  expect an unhealthy effect upon the skin. Where there is too little
  allowance for ventilation, insensible perspiration is checked, and
  something analogous to fever supervenes; foul tongue, ill taste, and
  lack of morning appetite betray the evil.

  In bruises, hot water is the most efficacious, both by means of
  insertion and fomentation, in removing pain, and totally preventing
  discoloration and stiffness. It has the same effect after a blow. It
  should be applied as quickly as possible, and as hot as it can be
  borne. The efficacy of hot water in preventing the ill effects of
  fatigue is too well-known to require notice.

<a name="p2454"></a><b><i>2454. &nbsp;Thinning the Blood</i></b><br>
<br>
  It is desirable to consider the means of thinning the blood, when it
  has been deprived, by too profuse transpiration in hot, dry winds, of
  its aqueous particles, and rendered thick and viscid. Water would
  easily supply this want of fluidity if it were capable of mingling
  with the blood when in this state; acid matter cannot be ultimately
  combined with the blood when the body is in this state. In order to
  find a menstruum by which water may be rendered capable of combining
  ultimately with the blood, of remaining long in combination with it,
  and of thinning it, we must mix it with a substance possessing the
  property of a soap, and consequently fit to dissolve viscous matters,
  and make them unite with water.<br>
<br>
  The soap must contain but little salt, that it may not increase the
  thirst of the parched throat. It must not have a disagreeable taste,
  that it may be possible to drink a considerable quantity of it: and it
  must be capable of recruiting the strength without overloading the
  stomach.<br>
<br>
  Now all these qualities are to be found in the yolk of egg. No
  beverage, therefore, is more suitable (whilst it is very agreeable)
  for hot, dry weather than one composed of the yolk of an egg beaten up
  with a little sugar according to taste, and mixed with a quart of cool
  spring or filtered water, half a glass of Moselle or any other Rhenish
  wine, and some lemon juice. The wine, however, may be omitted, and
  only the lemon juice be used; in like manner, hartshorn shavings
  boiled in water may be substituted for the yolk of egg. Equal
  quantities of beef tea and whey are good for delicate infants.

  The following receipt for the destruction originated with Dr. Ure, and

<br>
  Melt hog's-lard in a bottle plunged in water, heated to about 150
  degrees of Fahrenheit; introduce into it half an ounce of phosphorus
  for every pound of lard; then add a pint of proof spirit, or whisky;
  cork the bottle firmly after its contents have been heated to 150
  degrees, taking it at the same time out of the water, and agitate
  smartly till the phosphorus becomes uniformly diffused, forming a
  milky-looking liquid. This liquid, being cooled, will afford a white
  compound of phosphorus and lard, from which the spirit spontaneously
  separates, and may be poured off to be used again for the same
  purpose, but not for drinking, for none of it enters into the
  combination, but it merely serves to comminute the phosphorus, and
  diffuse it in very small particles through the lard.<br>
<br>
  This compound, on being warmed very gently, may be poured out into a
  mixture of wheat flour and sugar, incorporated therewith, and then
  flavoured with oil of rhodium, or not, at pleasure. The flavour may be
  varied with oil of aniseed, &amp;c. This dough, being made into pellets,
  is to be laid into rat-holes. By its luminousness in the dark, it
  attracts their notice, and being agreeable to their palates and noses,
  it is readily eaten, and proves certainly fatal.

<a name="p2486b"></a><b><i>2486b. &nbsp;Manifold Writing<a href="#p2486bf1"><sup>1</sup></a></i></b><br>
<br>
The demand for a rapid and simple method of multiplying letters,
  circulars, &amp;c., has led in recent years to the invention of several
  ingenious processes. So few copies are obtainable by the ordinary
  reporters' system of sheets of tissue paper, or "flimsy," interleaved
  with sheets of prepared black paper, that various kinds of "graphs"
  have been produced, by which upwards of a hundred, and in some cases
  many more, copies may be produced from one writing.<br>
<br>
  The "graph" process usually consists of transferring a writing made in
  an aniline dye on to a gelatine surface, from which, by the
  application of successive sheets of paper, subjected to a smoothing
  pressure by the hand, a number of copies may be obtained, in a manner
  very similar to the ordinary lithographic process. All those which may
  be classed as "gelatine transfer" processes are, however, open to the
  objection that, after a certain number of copies, the colour grows
  very faint.<br>
<br>
  Some other methods of manifold writing, such es the Edison, the
  Trypograph, the Cyclostyle, &amp;c. (by which 1,000 copies can be taken
  from one writing), do not possess this fault, being based on a
  principle of a fine stencil on prepared paper, and squeezing ink
  through the minute perforations on to a sheet of paper fixed
  underneath. The writing in these stencil systems, however, has a
  "dotty" and broken appearance, displeasing to many eyes&mdash;the
  Cyclostyle being, perhaps, least faulty in this respect. For those who
  would like to make a gelatine "graph," we append the following recipe:<br>
<br>
  Six parts by weight of pure glycerine, four parts by weight of water,
  two parts of barium sulphate, and one part of sugar. Mix them, and let
  them soak for twenty-four hours; then melt at a gentle heat, stir
  until thoroughly mixed, and pour the composition into a tray. Any
  chemist will supply an aniline dye for the ink.

<a name="p2487"></a><b><i>2487. &nbsp;Cements</i></b><br>
<br>

  The term "cement" includes all those substances employed for the
  purpose of causing the adhesion of two or more bodies, whether
  originally separate, or divided by an accidental fracture. As the
  various substances that may require cementing differ very much in
  texture, &amp;c., a number of cements possessed of very different
  properties are required, because a cement that answers admirably under
  one set of circumstances may be perfectly useless in others. The
  general principles upon which the success or failure of cementing
  usually depends are:<br>
<br>
  The different parts of a solid are held together by an attraction
  between their several particles, which is termed the attraction of
  cohesion. This attraction acts only when the particles are in the
  closest possible contact: even air must not be between them. If, after
  breaking any substance, we could bring the particles into as close a
  contact as before, and perfectly exclude the air, they would re-unite,
  and be as strongly connected as ever. But in general this is
  impossible: small particles of grit and dust get between them; the
  film of interposed air cannot be removed; and thus, however firmly we
  press the edges of a broken cup together, it remains cracked china
  still.<br>
<br>
  The cohesion between the particles of the cement is very much less
  than the adhesion of the cement to other bodies; and if torn apart,
  the connected joint gives way, not by the loosening of the adhesion,
  but by the layer of cement splitting down the centre. Hence the
  important rule that the _less_ cement in a joint the stronger it is.
  To unite broken substances with a thick cement is disadvantageous, the
  object being to bring the surfaces as closely together as possible.
  The general principles that ought always to be borne in mind having
  been mentioned, the manufacture and uses of some of the more useful
  cements may be described.

  The very useful preparation sold under this title is merely a thin
  cake of soluble glue, which, when moistened with the tongue, furnishes
  a ready means of uniting papers, &amp;c. It is made by dissolving one
  pound of fine glue or gelatine in water, and adding half a pound of
  brown sugar, boiling the whole until it is sufficiently thick to
  become solid on cooling; it is then poured into moulds, or on a slab
  slightly greased, and cut into the required shape when cool. (<i>See</i>

<a name="p2489"></a><b><i>2489. &nbsp;Paste</i></b><br>
<br>
Paste is usually made by rubbing up flour with cold water, and
  boiling; if a little alum is mixed before boiling it is much improved,
  being less clammy, working more freely in the brush, and thinner, a
  less quantity is required, and it is therefore stronger. If required
  in large quantity, as for papering rooms, it may be made by mixing one
  quartern of flour, one quarter pound of alum, and a little warm water;
  when mixed, the requisite quantity of boiling water should be poured
  on whilst the mixture is being stirred.  Paste is only adapted to
  cementing paper; when used it should spread on one side of the paper,
  which should then be folded with the pasted side inwards, and allowed
  to remain a few minutes before being opened and used; this swells the
  paper, and permits its being mere smoothly and securely attached. If
  kept for a few days, paste becomes mouldy, and after a short time
  putrid; this inconveince may be obviated by the use of:

<a name="p2491"></a><b><i>2491. &nbsp;Liquid Glue</i></b><br>
<br>
  The liquid glue of the shops is made by dissolving shellac in water, by
  boiling it along with borax, which possesses the peculiar property of
  causing the solution of the resinous lac. This preparation is
  convenient from its cheapness and freedom from smell; but it gives way
  if exposed to long-continued damp, which that made with naphtha
  resists.

<br>
  Of the use of <i>common glue</i> very little need be said; it should always
  be prepared in a gluepot or double vessel, to prevent its being
  burned, which injures it very materially. The chief objection to the
  use of this contrivance is, that it renders it impossible to heat the
  glue in the inner vessel to the boiling point; this, however, can be
  obviated by employing in the outer vessel some liquid which boils at a
  higher temperature than pure water, such as a saturated solution of
  salt (made by adding one-third as much salt as water). This boils at
  224° Fahr., 12° above the heat of boiling water, and enables the glue
  in the inner vessel to be heated to a much higher temperature than
  when pure water is employed. If a saturated solution of nitre is used,
  the temperature rises still higher.

  Lime and Egg Cement is frequently made by moistening the edges to be

  and bringing the edges into contact. A much better mode is to slake
  some freshly-burned lime with a small quantity of <i>boiling</i> water;
  this occasions it to fall into a very fine dry powder, if excess of
  water has not been added. The white of egg used should be intimately
  and thoroughly mixed, by beating with an equal bulk of water, and the
  slaked lime added to the mixture, so as to form a thin paste, which
  should be used speedily, as it soon sets. This is a valuable cement,
  possessed of great strength, and capable of withstanding boiling
  water. Cements made with lime and blood, scraped cheese, or curd, may
  be regarded as inferior varieties of it.

<br>
  For the imitating of fruit in wax, very different rules are to be
  observed. The following directions may, however, be generally
  followed:<br>
<br>
  The material of which moulds for waxen fruit should be composed is the
  <i>best</i> plaster of Paris, such as is used for plaster casts, &amp;c. If
  this cannot be procured, the inferior plaster, from the oil-shop, may
  be substituted, if it can be obtained <i>quite fresh</i>. If, however, the
  plaster is faulty, the results of the modelling will of course be more
  or less faulty also. It is the property of plaster of Paris to form a
  chemical union with water, and to form a pasto winch rapidly "sets" or
  hardens into a substance of the density of firm chalk. The mould must
  therefore be formed by impression from the object to be imitated, made
  upon the plaster before it sets.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p2538"></a><b><i>2538. &nbsp;Causes of Want of Accuracy</i></b><br>
<br>
  The use of an elastic fruit in early experiments leads to a want of
  accuracy in the first, steps of the operation, which causes very
  annoying difficulties afterwards; and therefore a solid, inelastic
  body&mdash;an egg boiled hard&mdash;is recommended as the first object to be
  imitated.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p2539"></a><b><i>2539. &nbsp;Making the Moulds&mdash;First Half</i></b><br>
<br>
Having filled a small pudding basin about three-quarters full of damp
  sand (the finer the better), lay the egg lengthways in the sand, so
  that half of it is above, and half below, the level of the sand, which
  should be perfectly smooth around it. Then prepare the plaster in
  another basin, which should be half full of water. Sprinkle the
  plaster in quickly till it comes to the top of the water, and then,
  having stirred it for a moment with a spoon, pour the whole upon the
  egg in the other basin.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p2540"></a><b><i>2540. &nbsp;Making the Moulds&mdash;Second Half</i></b><br>
<br>
  While the half mould thus made is hardening thoroughly, carefully
  remove every particle of plaster from the basin in which it was mixed,
  and also from the spoon which has been used.  This must be done by
  placing them both in water and wiping them perfectly clean. This is
  highly important, since a small quantity of plaster which has set will
  destroy the quality of a second mixing if it is incorporated
  therewith.  In about five minutes the half mould will be fit to
  remove, which may be done by turning the basin up with the right hand
  (taking care not to lose the sand), so that the mould falls into the
  left hand.<br>
<br>
  The egg should then be gently allowed to fall back on the sand out of
  the mould; if, however, it adheres, lightly scrape the plaster from
  the edge of the mould, and then shake it out into the hollow of the
  hand. If, however, the exact half of the egg has been immersed in the
  sand, no such difficulty will arise; this shows how important is
  exactness in the first position of the object from which a tasting is
  to be taken.<br>
<br>
  The egg being removed and laid aside, the moulder casting must be
  "trimmed;" that is, the sand must be brushed from the flat surface of
  the mould with a nail-brush very slightly, without touching the
  extreme and sharp edges where the hollow of the mould commences. Then
  upon the broad edge from which the sand has been brushed, make four
  equi-distant hollows (with the round end of a table-knife), like the
  deep impression of a thimble's-end. These are to guide hereafter in
  the fixing of the second half of the mould. The egg should now be
  replaced in the casting, and the edge of the cast, with the holes,
  thoroughly lubricated with sweet oil, laid on with a feather, or what
  is better, a large camel-hair brush.

<a name="p2541"></a><b><i>2541. &nbsp;Casting Second Half of Mould</i></b><br>
<br>
  Into the small pudding basin from which the sand has been emptied,
  place with the egg upper-most the half mould, which, if the operation
  has been managed properly, should <i>fit</i> close at the edges to the side
  of the vessel; then prepare some more liquid plaster as before, and
  pour it upon the egg and mould, and while it is hardening, round it
  with the spoon as with the first half.

<br>

  readily separable, and the egg being removed, the mould is ready to
  cast in, after it has been set aside for an hour or two, so as to
  completely harden. This is the simplest form of mould, and all are

<a name="p2545"></a><b><i>2545. &nbsp;Large Castings made Hollow</i></b><br>
<br>
  Every large object to be imitated in wax should be cast <i>hollow</i>; and
  therefore, though the transparent lightness required in the imitation
  of fruits is not requisite in an artificial egg, the egg may be cast
  upon the same principle as a piece of fruit, in the following manner.<br>
<br>
  <i>Firstly</i>. The two pieces of the plaster of Paris mould must be soaked
  in hot water for ten minutes.<br>
<br>
  <i>Secondly</i>. The wax should in the meantime be very slowly melted in a
  small tin saucepan, with a spout to it, care being taken not to allow
  it to boil, or it will be discoloured. As to the quantity of wax to be
  melted, the following is a general rule:&mdash;If a lump, the size of the
  object to be imitated, be placed in the saucepan, it should be
  sufficient for casting twice, at least.<br>
<br>
  <i>Thirdly</i>. As soon as the wax is melted thoroughly, place the saucepan
  on the hob of the grate, and taking the parts of the mould from the
  hot water, remove the moisture from their surfaces by pressing them
  gently with a handkerchief or soft cloth. It is necessary to use what
  is called in some of the arts "a very light hand" in this operation,
  especially in drying moulds of fruits whose aspect possesses
  characteristic irregularities&mdash;such as those on the orange, the lemon,
  or the cucumber. The mould must not be <i>wiped</i>, but only <i>pressed</i>. If
  the <i>water</i> has not been hot enough, or if the drying is not performed
  quickly, the mould will be too cold, and the wax will congeal too
  rapidly, and settle in ridges and streaks; on the other hand, if the
  wax has been made too hot, it will adhere to the mould, and refuse to
  come out entire.<br>
<br>
  <i>Fourthly</i>. Having laid the two halves of the mould so that there can be
  no mistake in fitting the one in its exact place quickly on the other,
  pour from the saucepan into <i>one</i> of the half moulds nearly as much
  wax as will fill the hollow made by the model (egg), quickly fit the
  other half on the top of it, squeeze the two pieces tightly together
  in the hand, and still holding them thus, turn them over in every
  possible position, so that the wax which is slowly congealing in the
  internal hollow of the mould may be of equal thickness in all parts.
  Having continued this process at least two minutes, the hands (still
  holding and turning the mould) may be immersed in cold water to
  accelerate the cooling process. The perfect congealment of the wax may
  be known after a little experience by the absence of the sound of
  fluid on shaking the mould.<br>
<br>
  <i>Fifthly</i>.  As soon as the mould is completely cooled, the halves may be
  separated carefully, the upper being lifted straight up from the
  under, and if the operation has been properly managed, a waxen egg
  will be turned out of the mould.<br>
<br>
  <i>Lastly</i>. The egg will only require <i>trimming</i>, that is, removing the
  ridge which marks the line at which the halves of the mould joined,
  and polishing out the scratches or inequalities left by the knife with
  a piece of soft rag, wet with spirits of turpentine or spirits of
  wine.<br>
<br>
  It is always desirable to make several castings of the same object, as
  the moulds are apt to get chipped when laid by in a cupboard; and for
  this reason, as well as for the sake of practice, we recommend our
  pupils to make at least a dozen waxen eggs before they proceed to any
  other object. If they succeed in this <i>completely</i>, they may rest
  assured that every difficulty which is likely to meet them in any
  future operation will be easily overcome.

<a name="p2546"></a><b><i>2546. &nbsp;Colouring the Wax</i></b><br>
<br>
  While the wax is yet on the hob, and in a fluid state, stir into it a
  little <i>flake white</i>, in powder, and continue to stir the mixture
  while it is being poured into the half mould. It will be found that
  unless the fixing and shaking of the moulds is managed quickly, the
  colouring matter will settle on the side of the half into which the
  mixture is poured; a little care in manipulation is therefore again
  requisite. The colouring of the wax is a matter which comes easily
  enough by experiment. Oranges, lemons, large gooseberries, small
  cucumbers, &amp;c.,&amp;c., are excellent objects for practice.

<br>
  It will be noted by the accurate observer that the shell of the common
  hen's egg has a number of minute holes, which destroy the perfect
  smoothness of its appearance. This peculiarity is imitated in the
  following simple manner:&mdash;In the first place, very slightly prick with
  a fine needle the surface of your waxen egg, and then, having smeared
  it with spirits of turpentine, rub the surface all over. So as
  <i>nearly</i> to obliterate the marks of the needle point.

<a name="p2549"></a><b><i>2549. &nbsp;Imitation of Coloured Glass</i></b><br>
<br>
  In decorating his house an Englishman spends as much money as he can
  conveniently spare; the elegances and refinements of modern taste
  demand something more than mere comfort; yet though his walls are hung
  with pictures, his drawing-rooms filled with bijouterie, how is it
  that the windows of his hall, his library, his staircase, are
  neglected? The reason is obvious. The magnificent historical old
  stained glass might be envied, but could not be brought within the
  compass of ordinary means.<br>
<br>
  Recent improvements in printing in colours led the way to this
  beautiful invention, by which economy is combined with the most
  perfect results. A peculiar kind of paper is rendered perfectly
  transparent, upon which designs are printed in glass colours (<i>vitre
  de couleurs</i>), which will not change with the light. The paper is
  applied to the glass with a clear white varnish, and when dry, a
  preparation is finally applied, which increases the transparency, and
  adds tenfold brilliancy to the effect.
<br>

<a name="p2550"></a><b><i>2550. &nbsp;Imitation of Half-Light</i></b><br>
<br>
  There is another design, printed in imitation of the half-light
  (<i>abat-jour</i>); this is used principally for a ground, covering the
  whole surface of the glass, within which (the necessary spaces having
  been previously cut out before it is stuck on the glass) are placed
  medallion centres of Watteau figures, perfectly transparent, which
  derive increased brilliancy from the semi-transparency of the
  surrounding ground. This is by far the cheapest method, though
  involving extra trouble, as the plain grounds printed in sheets are
  only a fourth the price of the sheets which contain the medallion
  Watteau centres or other small designs suitable for the purpose.

<br>
  The transparent sheets measure 20-1/2 in. by 16-1/2, and are ready for
  immediate use. The other articles required are some clear white
  varnish, some liqueur diaphane, brushes, metal palettes, and ivory
  sticks.  These are all the appliances required.

<a name="p2552"></a><b><i>2552. &nbsp;Calculation of Quantities</i></b><br>
<br>
  To ascertain the quantity of designs required, measure your glass
  carefully, and then calculate how many sheets it will take (the sheets
  being 20-1/2 in. by 16-1/2 in. as given above). The sheets are
  arranged so that they can be joined together continuously, or cut to
  any size or shape.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p2553"></a><b><i>2553. &nbsp;Practical Instructions</i></b><br>
<br>
  Choose a fine day for the operation, as the glass should be perfectly
  dry, and unaffected by the humidity of the atmosphere.  Of course, if
  you have a choice, it is more <i>convenient</i> to work on your glass
  before it is fixed in the frame. If you are working on a piece of
  unattached glass, lay it on a <i>flat</i> table (a marble slab is
  preferable), over which you must previously lay a piece of baize or
  cloth to keep the glass steady.<br>
<br>
  The glass being thus fixed, clean and polish the side on which you
  intend to operate (in windows this is the inner side), then with your
  brush lay on it very equably a good coat of the prepared varnish; let
  this dry for <i>an hour</i>, more or less, according to the dryness of the
  atmosphere and the thickness of the coat of varnish; meantime cut and
  trim your designs carefully to fit the glass (if it is one entire
  transparent sheet you will find little trouble); then lay them on a
  piece of paper, face downwards, and damp the back of them with a
  sponge, applied several times, to equalize the moisture.<br>
<br>
  In ths operation arrange your time so that your designs may now be
  finally left to dry for fifteen minutes before application to the
  glass, the varnish on which has now become tacky or sticky, and in a
  proper state to receive them. Apply the printed side next to the glass
  without pressure; endeavour to let your sheet fall perfectly level and
  smooth on your glass, so that you may avoid leaving creases, which
  would be fatal.<br>
<br>
  Take now your palette, lay it flat on the design, and press out all
  the air-bubbles, commencing in the centre, and working them out at the
  sides; an ivory stick will be found useful in removing creases: you
  now leave this to dry, and after twenty-four hours apply a slight coat
  of the liqueur diaphane, leaving it another day, when, if dry, apply a
  second coat of the same kind, which must be left several days;
  finally, apply a coat of varnish over all.

<a name="p2554"></a><b><i>2554. &nbsp;Probable Results</i></b><br>
<br>
  If these directions are carefully followed, your glass will never be
  affected by time or any variations in the weather; it will defy hail,
  rain, frost, and dust, and can be washed the same as ordinary stained
  glass, to which, in some respects, it is even superior.

<br>
  It is impossible to enumerate the variety of articles to the
  manufacture of which Diaphanie may be successfully applied, as it is
  not confined to glass, but can be done on silk, parchment, paper,
  linen, &amp;c., <i>after they have been made transparent</i> which may be

<a name="p2556"></a><b><i>2556. &nbsp;Management of Paper, &amp;c.</i></b><br>
<br>
  Stretch your paper, or whatever it may be, on a frame or drawing
  board, then apply two successive coats (a day between each) of
  diaphanous liquor, and after leaving it to dry for <i>several</i> days,
  cover it with a thin layer of very clear size, and when dry it will be
  in a fit state to receive the coat of varnish and the designs.
<br>

<a name="p2557"></a><b><i>2557. &nbsp;Management of Textile Fabrics</i></b><br>
<br>
  Silk, linen, or other stuffs should be more carefully stretched, and
  receive a thicker coat of size than paper or parchment; the latter may
  be strained on a drawing or any other smooth board, by damping the
  sheet, and after pasting the edges, stretching it down while damp.
  Silk, linen, and other stuffs require to be carefully stretched on a
  suitable frame. <i>Whatever you use</i>, take great care to allow time to
  dry before applying the liqueur diaphane.

  All kinds of screens, lamp shades and glasses, lanterns, &amp;c., &amp;c., may
  be made in this way, as heat will produce no effect upon them.  The
  transparent pictures are successful, because they may be hung on a
  window frame or removed at will, and the window blinds are superior to
  anything of that kind yet produced.

<br>
  Thoroughly clean and free from grease the article to be decorated;
  then, having cut off the white paper margin of the drawing, dip one of
  the brushes into the transfer varnish, and give it a very light coat,
  being especially careful to cover the whole of the coloured portion,
  but not to allow it to touch the blank paper; then lay the drawing,
  face downwards, on the object to be ornamented, taking care to place
  it at once where it is to remain, as it would be spoilt by moving. If
  the varnish, on its first application, is too liquid, allow the
  picture to remain for about ten minutes to set.<br>
<br>
  Moisten the cloth with water, and lay it gently on the drawing which
  has been previously laid in its place on the object to be decorated;
  then rub it over with the paper-knife or roller, so as to cause the
  print to adhere in every part; this done, remove the cloth, well soak
  the paper with a camel-hair brush dipped in water, and immediately
  after lift the paper by one corner, and gently draw it off.<br>
<br>
  The picture will be left on the object, while the paper will come off
  perfectly white. Care must be taken that the piece of cloth, without
  being too wet, is sufficiently so to saturate the paper completely.
  The drawing must now be washed with a camel-hair brush, in clean
  water, to remove the surplus varnish, and then left till quite dry. On
  the following day, cover the picture with a light coat of the fixing
  varnish, to give brilliancy to the colours.

<br>
  To ornament dark-coloured objects, such as the bindings of books,
  Russia leather, blotting-cases, leathern bags, &amp;c., the picture must
  be previously covered with a mixture of opaque white varnish, taking
  care not to pass beyond the outline of the design. On the following

<br>
  Varnish the picture with the transfer varnish, as previously
  explained, following the outline of the design, then allow it to dry
  for an hour or two; when quite dry, pass a damp sponge over the entire
  surface of the sheet, so as to remove the composition which surrounds
  the picture, and which may spoil the object.<br>
<br>
  Let the paper dry once more, and varnish the picture again with the
  transfer varnish; in about ten minutes, place it face downward on the
  object to be decorated, and rub it with the paper-knife or roller,
  over the whole of its surface. Finally, moisten the paper with a wet
  brush, allow it to remain sufficiently long to become moist, then
  strip the paper off.<br>
<br>
  <i>To remove a spoilt picture from any object,</i> dip a soft rag in the
  essence, and rub it over the surface.

<br>
  As much of the interest of this game depends upon the arrangement of
  the hoops, it is essential that they should be fixed in the ground on
  definite principles.  In the first place, the starting peg is driven
  in at one end of the ground, and the turning peg is driven in at the
  other extremity. From each of these pegs a space of twelve feet
  intervenes; here a hoop is fixed; another space of ten feet
  intervenes, when a second hoop is fixed; a space of eight feet then
  succeeds, and at this point is formed what may be termed the base, on
  each side of which, at a distance of twenty feet, and succeeding each
  other at intervals of ten feet, three hoops are driven in. By this
  arrangement, a square is formed, the starting peg leading into its
  centre, and the turning peg leading from it. Where the ground is
  small, the distances may be contracted proportionally. Other
  arrangements of the hoops may he made at the discretion of the
  players, but the first-named plan will be found best worthy of
  adoption, as it affords the most excellent opportunities for the
  display of address and skill.

<a name="p2572"></a><b><i>2572. &nbsp;The Game</i></b><br>
<br>
  The game consists in striking the balls from the starting peg through
  the hoops to the peg at the opposite extremity. The balls are then
  driven back again to the starting peg. The game may be played by any
  number of persons not exceeding eight. A larger number renders the
  game tedious.  The best number is four. If two only play, each player
  may take two balls, and when as many as eight play, there should be
  two sides or sets. Each player takes a mallet, ball, and croquet clip
  of the same colour or number, the clip being used to indicate the hoop
  at which, in his turn, he aims. The division into sides, choice of
  balls, mallets, &amp;c., is determined by the players among themselves.

 In this game, as with many other sports when first established, there
  were differences of opinion on certain points of practice. In 1870,

  settled and adopted. They are now accepted by all players.<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>

    first hoop in a direct line between the pegs; and a ball having been
    struck is at once in play, and croquetable whether it shall have
    made the first hoop or not.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    A stroke is considered to have been taken if a ball is moved
    perceptibly; but should the player have struck it accidentally, and
    the umpire be satisfied that the stroke was accidental, the ball is
    replaced and the stroke taken again.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    If the player make a foul stroke he loses his turn and all the
    points made therein, and the balls remain where they lie, at the
    option of the adversary. The following are considered foul strokes:
<li style="list-style: none"><br>

<ol start=1 type="a"><li>

      To strike with the mallet another ball instead of or besides
      one's own in making the stroke.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="a"><li>

      To spoon, that is, to push a ball without an audible knock.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="a"><li>

      To strike a ball twice in the same stroke.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="a"><li>

      To stop a ball with the foot in taking a loose Croquet.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="a"><li>

      To allow a ball to touch the mallet in rebounding from the
      turning peg.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="a"><li>

      To fail to stir the passive ball in taking Croquet.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="a"><li>

      If a player, in striking at a ball which lies against a peg
      or wire, should move it from its position by striking a peg or
      wire, the ball must be replaced, and the stroke taken again.</li></ol></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    A player continues to play so long as he makes a point or hits a
    ball. A point consists in making a hoop or hitting the turning peg
    in order.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    The ball has made its hoop when, having passed through from the
    playing side and ceased to roll, it cannot be touched by a
    straight-edge placed across the wires on the side from which it was
    played.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    A player who hits a ball must take Croquet: that is, must
    strike his own ball while in contact with the other, so as
    perceptibly to stir both. In doing this he is _not_ allowed to place
    his foot on his ball. A player, when his turn comes round, may hit
    and Croquet each ball in succession, and can do this again after
    each point made, but between the points can only take Croquet once
    off each ball.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    A playing ball which hits another after making a point is in
    hand, and the striker can score no point till he has taken Croquet.
    After hitting another, a ball may be stopped by any player; but
    should it, in rolling, displace any of the other balls, such balls
    must remain where they are driven.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    When, at the commencement of a turn, two balls are found
    touching, Croquet must be taken at once, without repeating the hit.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    When a player, in his stroke, hits one or more balls, he must
    take Croquet off the ball that is struck first; but if he has hit
    two simultaneously, he may choose from which of them he will take
    it, and in both cases a second hit is required before he can take it
    from the other ball.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    Should the ball in making its hoop strike another that lies
    beyond the hoop and then pass through it, the hoop and the hit both
    count; but, should any part of the ball that is hit have been lying
    beneath the hoop, the Croquet must be taken, but the hoop does not
    count.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    A rover which strikes or is driven by another ball against the
    winning peg is out of the game, and must be removed from the ground.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    A player who pegs out a rover by a first hit cannot take
    Croquet from it, as the ball is out of the game, and he is not
    entitled to another stroke.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    Should a player play out of his turn, or with a wrong ball, and
    this be discovered by his antagonist before a second stroke in error
    has been made, the turn is lost, and all points made after the
    mistake, and the balls shall remain as they lay at the time the
    mistake was discovered, or be replaced to the satisfaction of the
    antagonist. But if he has made a second stroke before the error is
    discovered, he continues his break, and the next player follows with
    the ball that is next in rotation to the one with which he has
    played, and is liable to lose his turn, and all points made therein,
    if he plays with that which would have been the right ball if no
    mistake had been made.</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>

    Should a player make the wrong hoop by mistake, or Croquet a
    ball that he is not entitled to Croquet, and the mistake be
    discovered before he has made a second stroke, he loses his turn,
    and any point so made in error; but if he has made a second stroke
    before the discovery, he shall be allowed to continue his break.</li></ol>

<ol start=17 type="i"><li>

    In order to prevent the occurrence of the errors noticed in
    the above rules (Nos. xv. and xvi), a player is bound, upon being
    appealed to, to declare truly what is his next hoop or point in
    order, and is entitled to demand of his antagonist what he his
    played last, and to insist upon his clip being properly placed.</li></ol>

<ol start=18 type="i"><li>

    When clips are used they should be moved by the umpire, or
    with his cognisance, at the end of each turn, and their position
    shall he conclusive as to the position of the balls in the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=19 type="i"><li>

    Should a ball in play be accidentally stopped by the umpire, he
    places it where he considers that it would have rolled to. Should it
    be stopped by a player, it will rest with the side opposed to that
    player to say whether the ball shall remain where it stopped, or be
    placed by the umpire, or the stroke be taken again.</li></ol>

<ol start=20 type="i"><li>

    If a ball lies within a mallet's length of the boundary, and is
    not the playing ball, it must at once be put out three feet at right
    angles from the boundary; but if it is the playing ball, it may, at
    the discretion of the player, either be put out or played from where
    it lies.</li></ol>

<ol start=21 type="i"><li>

    If it is found that the height of the boundary interferes with
    the stroke, the player may, at the umpire's discretion, bring out
    the ball so far as to allow of the free swing of the mallet, and in
    taking a Croquet both the balls.</li></ol>

<ol start=22 type="i"><li>

    Should a player, in trying to make his hoop, knock a wire out
    of the ground with his ball or mallet, the stroke shall be taken
    again.</li></ol>

<ol start=23 type="i"><li>

    Any player may set upright a peg or hoop except the one next
    in order; and that, however loose, awry, or slanting it may be, must
    not be altered except by the umpire.</li></ol>

<ol start=24 type="i"><li>

    No ball may be moved because of its lying in a hole or on bad
    ground, except by the umpire or with his permission.</li></ol>

<ol start=25 type="i"><li>

    Where there is no umpire present, permission to move a ball, or
    to set up a hoop or peg or other indulgence for which an umpire
    would have been appealed to, must be asked of the other side.</li></ol>

<ol start=26 type="i"><li>

    The decision of the umpire shall in all cases be final. His
    duties are: 
<li style="list-style: none"><br>

<ol start=1 type="a"><li>
    
      To move the clips, or see that they are properly moved;</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="a"><li>

      to decide on the application of the laws;</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="a"><li>

       to satisfy any player as to the point that is next to be
      made, or the right ball to play;</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="a"><li>

      to keep the score. But he shall not give his opinion, or
      notice any error that may be made, unless appealed to by one of
      the players.</li></ol></ol>

    its hoop at its next stroke.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    If in taking Croquet the striker's ball go off the ground, the
    striker loses the remainder of his turn; but if by the same stroke

<br>
  The chief difference (says Captain Crawley) between these and previous
  laws will be found in the method of taking the Croquet. The new laws
  say that the foot must <i>not</i> be placed on the player's ball; the
  generally accepted practice was to take the Croquet by putting your
  foot on your ball and striking it so as to send the other bill off to
  a distance; or if the other ball belonged to your partner to merely
  tap it in the direction desired. The foot practice is still observed
  by many players; and some think with advantage.

Into these holes ivory balls are driven by a leather pointed cue. The
  player stands at the lower end of the table; and his object is to hole
  the balls successively into the several cups. Nine balls are used,
  eight white and one red; or seven white with two coloured balls. The
  red is placed on a spot just in front of the 1 hole; and the game is
  played according to the following:

  The French Game (or Sans Egal) is played as follows:&mdash;The player who

  opponent, and placing the black ball on the spot. He plays at it from
  baulk, and scores all he can. The other player then strikes up one of

  points winning.  While the coloured ball is on the table, it must be
  struck, and when it is holed it counts double, in addition to any
  other score made by the same stroke. If either player hole his
  adversary's ball he forfeits to him the number scored by the stroke.
  If he fail to strike the black ball he forfeits five points. The rules
  as to rebounding balls, foul strokes, &amp;c., are the same as in the

  filled after making a canon score to the player. One point is

  Mississippi, Trou Madame, Cockamaroo, and other toy-games are

  To play well at any of the games, however, requires great care and
  nicety.  Much depends on the manner of holding and using the cue, and
  the slight degree of force employed in making the stroke. Some experts
  are able to fill all the holes at one essay, placing the coloured
  balls in the 8 and 7 at the first stroke, and then playing direct at
  the cups or at the cushion, till all the balls are holed. At the
  French Game a hundred or more canons at a break is by no means unusual.

<br>
  This well-known game of skill is played on a rectangular table with
  three ivory balls,&mdash;white, spot-white, and red; the object being to
  drive one or other of them into either of the six pockets, and to
  strike one ball against the two others. The first stroke is known as a
  hazard, and the second as a canon. The instrument for striking at the
  ball, is a long tapering stick called a cue; and the game is scored by
  hazards, canons, misses, and forfeitures.  The ball struck with the
  cue is known as the player's ball; the ball played as the object ball.
  A ball struck into a pocket, is a winning hazard; the player's ball
  falling into a pocket after contact with the white or red, is a losing
  hazard. Three principal games are played on the billiard table&mdash;the
  English game, or Billiards, Pyramids, and Pool.

<br>
English Billiards,&mdash;the best of all the games,&mdash;is usually played 50
  or 100 up. The points are thus reckoned&mdash;three for each red hazard,
  two for each white hazard, and two for each canon.  A coup&mdash;that is
  running in a pocket, or off the table without striking a ball&mdash;is a
  forfeiture of three points,&mdash;a miss gives one point to the adversary.
  The game commences by stringing for lead and choice of balls. The red
  ball is placed on the spot at the top of the table, and the first
  player either strikes at it, or gives a miss.  Every time the red ball
  is pocketed, it is replaced on the spot. He who makes a hazard or
  canon goes on playing till he fails to score. Then the other goes on,
  and so they play alternately till one or other completes the required
  number of points, and wins the game.

  The centre of the apex ball covers the second or pyramid spot; and the
  first player strikes at the mass with a white ball from baulk.
  Pyramids is a game consisting entirely of winning hazards, and he who
  succeeds in pocketing the greatest number of balls, wins. A single
  point is scored for each winning hazard, and a forfeiture of a point
  for each losing hazard; the game being usually played for a stake&mdash;so
  much (say 6d.) a ball, and so much (say 1s. 6d.) for the game.

<a name="p2585"></a><b><i>2585. &nbsp;Pool</i></b><br>
<br>
  A game played by two or more persons, consisting of winning hazard
  only. Each player subscribes a certain stake to form a pool or gross
  sum, and at starting has three chances or lives. He is then provided
  with a marked or coloured ball, and the game proceeds thus:<br>
<br>
  The white ball is placed on the spot, and the red is played on to it
  from baulk. If the player pocket the white he receives the price of a
  life from the owner of the ball; but if he fail, the next player
  (yellow) plays on the red; and so on alternately till all have played,
  or till a ball is pocketed. When a ball is pocketed, the striker plays
  at the ball nearest his own, and goes on playing as long as he can
  score. The first player who loses his three lives can star: that is,
  he can purchase as many lives as are held by the lowest number
  remaining in the pool. The order of play is usually red upon white,
  yellow upon red, green upon yellow, brown upon green, blue upon brown,
  black upon blue, spot-white upon black, white upon spot-white; and
  this order is retained so long as all the original players remain in
  the game. When the number of players is reduced to two, they can, if
  they possess an equality of lives, as two each, or one each, divide
  the stake; or they may by agreement play out the game for the entire
  pool.

<a name="p2591"></a><b><i>2591. &nbsp;Boss; or the Fifteen Puzzle</i></b><br>
<br>
Apparently simple,  this game is really difficult of solution, Fifteen
  cubes of wood, severally marked from I to 15, are placed indifferently
  in a box made to hold sixteen; thus:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/EI12.gif" width="330" height="167" align="middle" border="1" alt="two boxes, each holding 15 blocks"><br>
<br>
  The puzzle consists in sliding the cubes from square to square,
  without lifting them or removing them from the box, until they are
  placed in their natural order. It is easy enough to move the squares
  up to 12; but to get the last three into order is often a puzzle
  indeed. If the figures fall in either of the following positions&mdash;13,
  15, 14; 14, 13, 15; or 15, 14, 13&mdash;the problem is unsolvable; it
  follows, therefore, that the last row must be either 14, 15, 13; or
  15, 13, 14. If you get the cubes into either of these positions, you
  can easily bring them right; but if you cannot, the only way is to
  begin the game all over again. Several other ways are suggested.
  Cavendish (Mr. H. Jones) thinks he solves the puzzle by turning the
  box half round; but as this is only possible when the figures are on
  circular pieces of wood, his solution merely cuts the knot, instead of
  unravelling it.

<a name="p2592"></a><b><i>2592. &nbsp;The Thirty-Four Puzzle</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is an adaptation of tho old magic square, which amused the
  philosophers of old. A sketch of it appears in Albert Durer's painting
  of Melancholia. Sixteen discs or squares, numbered from 1 to 16, are
  placed indifferently on the table&mdash;or they may be in the fifteen box;
  and the puzzle is to so arrange them as to make the sum of the figures
  add up to 34, whether counted up, down, across or angularly. Here is
  the solution:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/EI13.gif" width="333" height="159" align="middle" border="1" alt="two boxes, each holding 16 blocks"><br>
<br>
This is the simplest; but a more elaborate plan is to so arrange the
  figures that any form of the blocks will form a square sum of 34. See
  the annexed solution, which the ingenious in may still further
  complicate:<br>

<a name="p2593"></a><b><i>2593. &nbsp;Fox and Geese</i></b><br>
<br>
  This old-fashioned game is played on a solitaire board. Seventeen
  geese occupy the upper part of the board lines, with the fox in the
  middle, thus:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/EI15.gif" width="318" height="289" align="middle" border="1" alt="fox and geese board"><br>
<br>
  The object of the game is to confine the fox in a corner, so that he
  cannot move. The geese march forward in straight lines, not on the
  diagonals; and whenever a goose is on the spot next the fox, the
  latter can take him, as in draughts, by jumping over to the vacant
  spot beyond. The fox can move backwards, forwards, or sideways on the
  straight lines; but the geese must go forward, and are not allowed to
  retreat. Properly played, the geese must win; but when the number of
  geese is reduced to six, it is impossible for them to confine the fox.<br>
<br>
  There are several ways of playing the game, by placing the fox and
  geese in other positions, or by insisting on the fox catching all the
  geese. In the latter case, the fox chooses his own starting place. The
  game may also be played with eight geese and a fox.<br>
<br>
  Another way of playing this game is on an ordinary draughtboard, with
  four white men for the geese, and a black king for the fox. The geese
  can only move forward, but the fox moves either way. The object of the
  geese is to pen up the fox so that he cannot move; the object of the
  fox is to break through the line of defence. If the game be properly
  played, the geese must win. Place them on the draughtboard thus:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/EI16.gif" width="304" height="300" align="middle" border="1" alt="fox and geese oon draught board"><br>
<br>
  The secret is to keep the geese in a line. The fox tries to prevent
  this, and if he can succeed in doubling the geese, or getting one to
  stand before the other, he is nearly sure to pass through them.

<a name="p2594"></a><b><i>2594. &nbsp;The Royal Game of Goose</i></b><br>
<br>
  In the old German game the figure of a goose is printed on a large
  sheet of paper, and divided into 63 squares or divisions. The object
  of the players,&mdash;any number of whom may join in the game&mdash;is to make
  63 points by successive throws of two dice. A pool is made by equal
  contributions by the players, the first of whom gaining the required
  number wins. The players throw alternately and add each individual
  throw to that already made. <br>
<br>
Each player's position is shown on the
  goose by a counter, a wafer, or any small article. Any number beyond
  63 sends the thrower back as many points as he exceeds 63. Thus if he
  were 58, and by a 6 and 5 he threw eleven he would go forward 5
  squares to 63, and back 6 squares from 63. In addition to this,
  certain numbers on the goose are barred; and if the player make them
  he is fined two counters, which are added to the pool. The numbered
  goose is sold at most toy shops, but a numbered draughtboard will
  serve as well.

<a name="p2595"></a><b><i>2595. &nbsp;Troco or Lawn Billiards</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is a game that may be played by any number of persons in a field
  or open space. The implements are wooden balls and long-handled cues
  at the ends of which are spoonlike ovals of iron. In the centre of the
  Troco ground is fixed a ring of iron, which moves freely on a pivot,
  the spike of the ring being driven into a piece of wood let into the
  ground. The wooden ball is lifted from the ground by means of the
  spoon-ended cue, and thrown towards the ring&mdash;the object of the player
  being to pass the ball through the ring; and he who succeeds in making
  any given number of points by fairly ringing his ball, or canoning
  against the other balls, wins the game.<br>
<br>
  Canons are made by the player striking two balls successively with his
  own ball fairly delivered from his spoon. Thus (says the most recent
  writer on the game) a clever player may make a large number of
  points&mdash;five, seven, or more at a stroke: two the first canon, two for
  a second canon, and three for the ring. This, however, is very seldom
  accomplished.<br>
<br>
  Considerable skill is required in throwing the ball, as the ring,
  turning freely on its pivot, twists round on being struck. To "make
  the ring," it is necessary, therefore, that the ball be thrown fairly
  through its centre. But in order to get nearer to it a judicious
  player will endeavour to make two or three canons, if the balls lie
  within a convenient distance and at a proper angle to each other. If
  the ball be thrown with sufficient force, it will glance off from the
  ball struck in a line corresponding to its first or original line of
  projection.

<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
 Troco may be played by two or more persons, each of whom is
    provided with a ball and a cue. When more than two play, sides are
    chosen, and the side which first makes the requisite number of
    points wins the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    The players stand in a circle, in the centre of which is set up
    the pivot-ring.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Each player starts from any portion of the circle distant not
    less than four yards from the ring. The first player lifts his ball
    with the spoon-cue, and throws it towards the ring; each of the
    others taking his turn alternately&mdash;the balls remaining on the
    ground where they stop rolling.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    If the first player fail to "make his ring," the next goes on,
    who may either throw at the ring or at the ball in the circle.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    Partners may assist each other in getting near the ring; but no
    player, at starting, may step within four yards of the ring.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    <i>Two</i> points are counted for every canon, and <i>three</i> for every
    fairly-made ring; and successive points are reckoned for any number
    of rings or canons.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    Each player goes on till he fails to canon or ring his ball;
    when the next plays; and so on, till the required number of points
    are made.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    One point is taken off the player's score for every foul
    stroke. Foul strokes are made by touching a ball with hand or person
    while it is in play; by playing with a wrong ball; by playing out of
    turn; by overturning the ring; and by making two or more steps while
    throwing the ball.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    Each player, after the start, must go on from the place at which
    his ball was left after the previous stroke.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    All disputed points must be settled by the umpire, whose decision
    is final.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    No ball in-play must be removed from its position except by a
    stroke from another ball, and every ball is considered to be in-play
    while it is within the circle, which may be of any dimensions chosen
    by the players previous to the commencement of the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    Any player leaving a game before it is finished, loses it.</li></ol><br>
<br>
  The game is played fifteen, twenty-one, or any other determined number
  of points. The balls should be perfectly round and smooth. They are
  generally made of boxwood or lignum vitæ, and weigh about three to
  five lbs. each; the balls, cues, &amp;c., are sold by most dealers in
  croquet implements.

  Let us take the case of a person who has no intimate knowledge of any
  particular trade, but having a very small capital, is about to embark
  it in the exchange of commodities for cash, in order to obtain an
  honest livelihood thereby. It is clear, that unless such a person
  starts with proper precaution and judgment, the capital will be
  expended without adequate results; rent and taxes will accumulate, the
  stock will lie dead or become deteriorated, and loss and ruin must
  follow. For the last absorption acting upon a small capital will soon
  dry up its source; and we need not picture the trouble that will arise
  when the mainspring of a tradesman's success abides by him no more.
<br>

<a name="p2600"></a><b><i>2600. &nbsp;Larger Capitalists</i></b><br>
<br>
  The case of the larger capitalist can scarcely be considered an
  exception to the same rule. For it is probable that the larger
  capitalist, upon commencing a business, would sink more of his funds
  in a larger stock&mdash;would incur liability to a heavier rent; and the
  attendant taxes, the wages of assistants and servants would be
  greater, and, therefore, if the return came not speedily, similar
  consequences must sooner or later ensue.

<a name="p2601"></a><b><i>2601. &nbsp;Localities</i></b><br>
<br>
  Large or small capitalists should, therefore, upon entering on a
  shopkeeping speculation, consider well the nature of the locality in
  which they propose to carry on trade, the number of the population,
  the habits and wants of the people, and the extent to which they are
  already supplied with the goods which the new adventurer proposes to
  offer them.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="10766-h.htm#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p2602"></a><b><i>2602. &nbsp;New Neighbourhoods</i></b><br>
<br>
  There is a tendency among small capitalists to rush into new
  neighbourhoods with the expectation of making an early connection. Low
  rents also serve as an attraction to these localities. General
  experience, however, tends to show that the early suburban shops
  seldom succeed. They are generally entered upon at the very earliest
  moment that the state of the locality will permit&mdash;often before the
  house is finished the shop is tenanted, and goods exposed for
  sale&mdash;even while the streets are unpaved, and while the roads are as
  rough and uneven as country lanes.<br>
<br>
  The consequence is, that as the few inhabitants of these localities
  have frequent communication with adjacent centres of business, they,
  as a matter of habit or of choice, supply their chief wants thereat;
  and the newly arrived shopkeeper has to depend principally for support
  upon the accidental forgetfulness of his neighbour, who omits to bring
  something from the cheaper and better market; or upon the changes of
  the weather, which may sometimes favour him by rendering a "trip to
  town" exceedingly undesirable.

<br>
  "While the grass is growing the horse is starving;" and thus, while
  the new district is becoming peopled the funds of the small shopkeeper
  are gradually eaten up, and he puts up his shutters just at the time
  when a more cautious speculator steps in to profit by the connection
  already formed, and to take advantage of the new improved condition of
  the locality. It seems, therefore, desirable for the small capitalists
  rather to run the risk of a more expensive rent, in a well-peopled
  district, than to resort to places of slow and uncertain demand; for
  the welfare of the small shopkeeper depends entirely upon the
  frequency with which his limited stock is cleared out and replaced by

<a name="p2604"></a><b><i>2604. &nbsp;Precautions</i></b><br>
<br>
  But should the small capitalist still prefer opening in a suburban
  district, where competition is less severe, and rents and rates less
  burdensome, there are certain precautions which he will do well to
  observe.  He should particularly guard against opening a shop to
  supply what may be termed the superfluities of life; for the
  inhabitants of new suburban districts are those who, like himself,
  have resorted to a cheap residence for the sake of economy. Or if this
  be not the case&mdash;if they are people of independent means, who prefer
  the "detached villa" to the town house, squeezed up on both sides,
  they have the means of riding and driving to town, and will prefer
  choosing articles of taste and luxury from the best marts, enriched by
  the finest display.

<br>
  The suburban shopkeeper should, therefore, confine himself to
  supplying the <i>necessaries</i> of life. Hungry people dislike to fetch
  their bread from five miles off; and to bring vegetables from a long
  distance would evidently be a matter of considerable inconvenience.
  The baker, the butcher, the greengrocer, the beer retailer, &amp;c., are
  those who find their trade first established in suburban localities.
  And not until these are doing well should the tailor, the shoemaker,
  the hatter, the draper, the hosier, and others, expect to find a
  return for their capital and reward for their labour.

<a name="p2606"></a><b><i>2606. &nbsp;Civility</i></b><br>
<br>
  In larger localities, where competition abounds, the small shopkeeper
  frequently outstrips his more powerful rival by one element of
  success, which may be added to any stock without cost, but cannot be
  withheld without loss. That element is <i>civility</i>. It has already been
  spoken of elsewhere, but must be enforced here, as aiding the little
  means of the small shopkeeper to a wonderful degree. A kind and
  obliging manner carries with it an indescribable charm. It must not be
  a manner which indicates a mean, grovelling time-serving spirit, but a
  plain, open, and agreeable demeanour, which seems to desire to oblige
  for the pleasure of doing so, and not for the sake of squeezing an
  extra penny out of a customer's pocket.

<br>
  The sole reliance of the shopkeeper should be in the integrity of his
  transactions, and in the civility of his demeanour. He should make it
  the interest and the pleasure of the customer to come to his shop. If
  he does this, he will form the very best "connections," and so long as
  he continues this system of business, they will never desert him.

  He should cheerfully render his best labour and knowledge to serve
  those who approach his counter, and place confidence in his
  transactions; make himself alike to rich and poor, but never resort to
  mean subterfuge and deception to gain approbation and support. He
  should be frugal in his expenditure, that in deriving profits from
  trade, he may not trespass unduly upon the interest of others; he
  should so hold the balance between man and man that he should feel
  nothing to reprove his conscience when the day comes for him to repose
  from his labours and live upon the fruits of his industry. Let the

The great philosopher, Dr. Franklin, inspired the mouthpiece of

    serene," encased in the homely garb of proverbial truisms. On the
    subject of frugality we cannot do better than take the worthy Mentor
    for our text, and from it address our remarks. A man may, if he
    knows not how to save as he gets, "keep his nose all his life to the
    grindstone, and die not worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen makes a
    lean will."</li></ol>

      <blockquote>"Many estates are spent in getting,<br>
      Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,<br>
      And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting."</blockquote>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>
     If you would be wealthy, think of saving as well as of getting.
    The Indies have not made Spain rich, because her out-goes are
    greater than her in-comes.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

     "What maintains one vice would bring up two children."</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or superfluities now
    and then, diet a little more costly, clothes a little finer, and a
    little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but
    remember, "Many a little makes a mickle."</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    Beware of little expenses: "A small leak will sink a great

    them."</li></ol>

    Here you are all got together to this sale of fineries and
    nick-nacks. You call them goods; but if you do not take care they
    will prove evils to some of you. You expect they will be sold cheap,
    and perhaps they may, for less than they cost; but if you have no
    occasion for them they must be dear to you.</li></ol>

<br>
If you would get rich, don't deal in bill books. Credit is the
  "Tempter in a new shape." Buy goods on trust, and you will purchase a
  thousand articles that cash would never have dreamed of. A shilling in
  the hand looks larger than ten shillings seen through the perspective
  of a three months' bill. Cash is practical, while credit takes
  horribly to taste and romance. Let cash buy a dinner, and you will
  have a beef-steak flanked with onions. Send credit to market, and he
  will return with eight pairs of woodcocks and a peck of mushrooms.
  Credit believes in diamond pins and champagne suppers. Cash is more
  easily satisfied. Give him three meals a day, and he doesn't care much
  if two of them are made up of roasted potatoes and a little salt. Cash
  is a good adviser, while credit is a good fellow to be on visiting
  terms with. If you want double chins and contentment, do business with
  cash.

<a name="p2613"></a><b><i>2613. &nbsp;Hints upon Money Matters</i></b><br>
<br>
  Have a supply of change in hand&mdash;shillings, sixpences, halfpence. This
  will obviate the various inconveniences of keeping people at the door,
  sending out at unreasonable times, and running or calling after any
  inmate in the house, supposed to be better provided with "the
  needful." The tradespeople with whom you regularly deal will always
  give you extra change, <i>when</i> you are making purchases or paying
  bills; while those to whom you apply for it, on a sudden emergency,
  may neither be willing nor able to do so. Some housekeepers object to
  this arrangement, that, "as soon as five-pound notes or sovereigns are
  changed, they always seem to go, without their understanding how;" but
  to such persons I would humbly intimate, that this is rather the fault
  of their <i>not getting understanding</i>, than any inevitable consequence
  of <i>getting change</i>.<br>
<br>
  The fact is, that it is the necessity of parting with your money which
  obliges you to get the larger pieces changed, and not the circumstance
  of having smaller coin that <i>necessitates</i> your parting with your
  money, though it certainly facilitates your doing so when the
  necessity arrives. However, as it is easier to count a few sovereigns
  than many shillings, and loose money is most objectionable, it is well
  to put up reserve change in small collective packets, and to replenish
  the housekeeping purse from these daily or weekly, as may be most
  convenient.

<a name="p2614"></a><b><i>2614. &nbsp;Save Time and Trouble</i></b><br>
<br>
If Money for daily expenses has to pass through the hands of a
  servant, it is a time-and-trouble-saving plan to settle with her
  <i>every</i> night, and to make up her cash in hand to a certain <i>similar</i>
  sum. This will prevent such puzzling calculations as the
  following:
  
    <blockquote>"Let me see: I gave you 10s. on Saturday, and 9d. the day before.
    Was it 9d.? No, it must have been 11d., for I gave you 1s., and you
    gave me 1d. out for the beggar; then there was 6s. 6d. on Monday,
    and 8d. you owed me from last money; and then the 1s. 6d. your
    master gave you for a parcel&mdash;you brought him 2d. back, and 3d-1/2.
    out of the butcher's bill; no&mdash;<i>you</i> had to give 3-1/2d. to the
    butcher, but you came to me for the 1/2d., and I had no coppers, so
    we still owe him the 1/2d.; by the way, don't forget to pay him the
    next time you go. Then there's the baker&mdash;no, I paid the baker
    myself, and I <i>think</i> the housemaid paid the butter-man; but you got
    in the cheese the day before, and I have a sort of recollection that
    I may possibly owe you for <i>that</i>, all but a few pence you must have
    had left of mine, that I told you to take from off the
    chimney-piece. Well, cook, I think that's <i>nearly</i> all! Now how do
    your accounts stand?" </blockquote>
    
  This the poor cook, who <i>is</i> a cook, and <i>not</i> a conjuror, finds it no
  easy matter to discover; all that she is quite certain of is, that her
  disbursements have somewhat exceeded her receipts, and being an honest
  woman, though a poor one, she wishes to cheat neither her mistress nor
  herself; but what with her memory and her want of it, her involved
  payments, and different receipts; what she owed her mistress, and what
  her mistress owes her; what she got from her master, and what was
  partly settled by the housemaid; the balance from the butcher's bill,
  and the intricacies of the cheese account, the poor woman is perfectly
  bewildered. <br>
<br>
  She counts again and again; recapitulates her mistress's data and her
  own; sums upwards, backwards, and forwards, and endeavours to explain
  the differences between them; then, if she can read and write, she
  brings her slate to "explain the explanation," and the united
  calculations of maid and mistress, which are after all entirely
  unavailing to produce a more correct account, probably consume more
  time, and are expressed in more words, than would suffice to fill
  another volume like the present. Two minutes' daily reckoning from a
  <i>regular</i> sum in hand would do the business effectually, and prevent
  either party from being out of pocket or out of temper. Thus, for
  instance, the maid has her usual sum of five shillings to account for;
  she pays during the day, for:<br>
<br>
<table summary="daily costs" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td></td>
	<td><i>s.</i></td>
	<td><i>d.</i></td>

	<td>Bread</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>9</td>

</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><b>Total</b></td>
	<td><b>4</b></td>
	<td><b>6</b></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<br>
This is easily reckoned, even by the unlearned; the mistress enters
  the items in her day-book, takes the remaining sixpence, and again
  gives her servant 5s., in convenient change, to be as readily
  accounted for on the succeeding day.<br>

<a name="p2681"></a><b><i>2681. &nbsp;Remarks</i></b><br>
<br>
  Sufficient general instructions are here given to enable the carver,
  by observation and practice, to acquit himself well. The art of
  carving does not consist merely in dissecting the joints sent to
  table, but in the judicious and economical distribution of them, and
  the grace and neatness with which this distribution is effected. Every
  dish should be sent to table properly garnished (where needed), and
  the carver should preserve the neatness of the arrangement as much as
  possible.

<a name="p2682"></a><b><i>2682. &nbsp;Dyeing</i></b><br>
<br>
  The filaments from which stuffs of all kinds are fabricated are
  derived either from the animal or vegetable kingdom.  We recognise the
  former by the property they possess of liberating ammonia on being
  treated with potash; while the latter afford a liquor having an acid
  reaction under the same treatment. The animal kingdom furnishes three
  varieties&mdash;silk, wool, and the furs, &amp;c., of various animals; the
  vegetable kingdom also three&mdash;flax, hemp, and cotton: all of which
  require certain preliminary preparations to render them fit for the
  dyer, which do not come within our province, our space only admitting
  of a rapid glance at the production of the various colours.

Some colours adhere at once to the stuff, and are called <i>substantial
  colours</i>; while others require that the material to be dyed should
  undergo some previous preparation in order to render it permanent. The
  substances used to fix the colouring matters are called <i>mordants</i>,
  which should possess four qualifications:
  <br><br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    They should possess an equal affinity for the fibre of the
    material and the colouring matter.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    They should be incapable of injuring or destroying either by
    prolonged action.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    They should form, with the colour, a compound capable of
    resisting the action of air and water.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    They should be capable of readily conforming to the various
    operations of the dyer.</li></ol>

<a name="p2684"></a><b><i>2684. &nbsp;The Mordants</i></b><br>
<br>
  For the reasons just given, the acetate or tartrate of iron is
  preferable to the sulphate; and the acetate or tartrate of alumina to
  alum. <i>For reds, yellows, green, and pinks</i>, aluminous mordants are to
  be used.  <i>For blacks, browns, puces, and violets</i>, the acetate or
  tartrate of iron must be employed. <i>For scarlets</i>, use a tin mordant,
  made by dissolving in strong nitric acid one-eighth of its weight of
  sal-ammoniac, then adding by degrees one-eighth of its weight of tin,
  and diluting the solution with one-fourth of its weight of water.

  After drying it is to be steeped twice in dry alum water, then dried,

Three quarters of a pint of a tin mordant, made by dissolving three
  pounds of tin in sixty pounds of hydrochloric acid, is added to every
  pound of lac dye, and digested for six hours. To dye twenty-five
  pounds of cloth, a tin boiler of seventy-five gallons capacity should
  be filled nearly full with water, and a fire kindled under it.  When
  the heat is 150° Fahr., half a handful of bran and two ounces of tin
  mordant are to be thrown into it. The froth which arises is skimmed
  off, the liquor is made to boil, and two pounds and three quarters of
  lac dye, previously mixed with a pound and three quarters of the
  solvent, and fourteen ounces of the tin solvent, are added.<br>
<br>
  Immediately afterwards two pounds and three quarters of tartar, and a
  pound of ground sumach, both tied up in a linen bag, are to be added,
  and suspended in the bath for five minutes. The fire being withdrawn,
  five gallons of cold water and two pints and three quarters of tin
  mordant being poured into the bath, the cloth is immersed in it. The
  fire is then replaced, and the liquid made to boil rapidly for an
  hour, when the cloth is removed and washed in pure water.

  Strip the fur articles of their stuffing and binding, and lay them as

  a very brisk brushing, with a stiff clothes-brush; after this any
  moth-eaten parts must be cut out, and neatly replaced by new bits of
  fur to match.<br>
<br>
  Sable, chinchilla, squirrel, fitch, &amp;c., should be treated as follows:
  Warm a quantity of new bran in a pan, taking care that it does not
  burn, to prevent which it must be actively stirred. When well warmed,
  rub it thoroughly into the fur with the hand. Repeat this two or three
  times: then shake the fur, and give it another sharp brushing until
  free from dust.<br>
<br>
  White furs, ermine, &amp;c., may be cleaned as follows:&mdash;Lay the fur on a
  table, and rub it well with bran made moist with warm water; rub until
  quite dry, and afterwards with dry bran. The wet bran should be put on
  with flannel, and the dry with a piece of book muslin.<br>
<br>
  The light furs, in addition to the above, should be well rubbed with
  magnesia, or a piece of book muslin, after the bran process.<br>
<br>
  Furs are usually much improved by stretching, which may be managed as
  follows: To a pint of soft water add three ounces of salt, dissolve;
  with this solution, sponge the inside of the skin (taking care not to
  wet the fur) until it becomes thoroughly saturated; then lay it
  carefully on a board with the fur side downwards, in its natural
  position; then stretch as much as it will bear, and to the required
  shape, and fasten with small tacks. The drying may be accelerated by
  placing the skin a little distance from the fire or stove.

  will sink, and should remain in the lime water three or four days;
  after which the foul liquor should be separated from them, by laying
  them in a sieve.<br>

<br>
  When water is hard, and will not readily unite with soap, it will
  always be proper to boil it before use; which will be found
  sufficiently efficacious, if the hardness depends solely upon the
  impregnation of lime. Even exposure to the atmosphere will produce
  this effect in a great degree upon spring water so impregnated,
  leaving it much fitter for lavatory purposes.<br>
<br>
  In both cases the water ought to be carefully poured off from the
  sediment, as the neutralized lime, when freed from its extra quantity
  of carbonic acid, falls to the bottom by its own gravity.  To
  economize the use of soap, put any quantity of pearlash into a large
  jar, covered from the dust, in a few days the alkali will become
  liquid, which must be diluted in double its quantity of soft water,
  with an equal quantity of new-slacked lime. Boil it half an hour,
  frequently stirring it; adding as much more hot water, and drawing off
  the liquor, when the residuum may be boiled afresh, and drained, until
  it ceases to feel acrid to the tongue.

<br>
 A series of papers were published in the <i>Lancet</i> and elsewhere a few
  years back on the subject of Adulteration. These brought about a
  parliamentary inquiry; the inquiry ended in demonstrating that nearly
  everything we ate and drank was adulterated&mdash;in many cases with
  ingredients very prejudicial to human health. The result of the
  inquiry was the passing of an Act of Parliament in 1875 for the
  purpose of putting a stop to this wholesale adulteration by making it
  a criminal offence. The Act is called the "Sale of Foods and Drugs
  Act," and the following are the most important clauses it contains:

   <blockquote> "No person shall mix, colour, stain, or powder any article of food
    with any ingredient or material, so as to render the article
    injurious to health, with the intent that the same may be sold in
    that state, and no person shall sell such article under a penalty
    not exceeding £50."<br>
<br>
    "No person shall sell to the prejudice of the purchaser any article
    of food, or any drug which is not of the nature, substance, and
    quality of the article demanded under a penalty not exceeding £20."</blockquote>

  The Act also provides for the appointment of public analysts for
  counties and boroughs. An Act passed in 1887 provides that all
  substances or compounds made to imitate butter shall be sold as
  <i>Margarine</i>, and all wrappers, &amp;c., used in its sale must be plainly
  marked.  These Acts are intended for the protection of the public; but
  we give below the names of a few of the chief articles of consumption
  that are liable to be adulterated, and when possible how to detect the
  adulteration, or the best mode of avoiding it.

<br>
  The chief adulteration of <i>bread</i> is alum. This is added to give the
  bread a pure white colour, which is supposed to be an advantage, thus
  enabling the baker to use inferior or damaged flour. The presence of
  alum can be detected by soaking a piece of the bread in an ammoniaca
  tincture of logwood. If alum be present the bread will be turned
  <i>blue</i>, whereas pure bread will remain <i>pink</i>. Recent investigations
  have proved that the presence of alum is extremely injurious,
  especially to children, affecting the coats of the stomach and
  impairing the digestion.

  Those who prefer the pure cocoa can obtain the "nibs," or more
  properly "beans," and grind them. But many prefer the soluble cocoa,
  which is simply cocoa modified by admixture with less stimulating
  substances.

<br>
  Coffee is adulterated with roasted beans, peas, and acorns; but
  chiefly with chicory. Having your own mill, buy the roasted beans;
  find out a respectable grocer, ascertain his roasting-days, <i>and
  always buy from a fresh roast</i>. If you like the flavour of chicory,
  purchase it separately, and add to taste. Chicory in small quantities
  is not injurious, but you need not pay the coffee price for it. Grind
  your coffee, and mix it with chicory for yourself.

<br>
  This perhaps is more often adulterated than any other article of
  consumption. As a rule the water supplied by the companies to the
  large towns is exceedingly pure, that supplied by the London companies
  being analysed every month by a government official; but the
  adulteration chiefly rests with the consumer or householder, in not
  keeping the cisterns clean, dust, soot, and even dead mice,
  cockroaches, &amp;c., being allowed to contaminate the water; also by
  permitting the overflow pipe to be connected with the soil pipe, or
  drain, whence the water absorbs poisonous gases. The overflow pipes
  should in all cases be entirely disconnected with, all drains, and the
  cisterns should, if possible have a cover. The cisterns should
  invariably be cleaned out thoroughly at least every three months.<br>
<br>
  In places where the water is drawn from wells great care should be
  taken that the well cannot be contaminated by any drain or cesspool
  leaking into it. Many cases of serious illness, notably diphtheria,
  have been traced to this cause. When there is the least reason to
  doubt the purity of the well all the water for drinking purposes
  should be boiled before using, and no time should be lost in having it
  examined by an experienced analyst.  All water that is used for
  drinking should be first filtered through a <i>reliable</i> filter.  Small
  glass filters for the table can now be obtained in every town for two
  or three shillings.

The butcher cannot adulterate the beef and the mutton, but he can send

  ounces at one penny each, instead of one halfpenny; and the baker,
  besides putting alum into the bread, to make it white and retain
  water, can send home deficient weight; the same with the grocer, the
  greengrocer, and the coal merchant; the publican can give short
  measure, and froth up the porter to fill the jug and disguise the
  shortness of quantity; and the draper can slip his scissors on the
  wrong side of his finger, and make a yard contain only thirty-three
  inches. We don't mean to say that they <i>do</i> this, nor do we mean to
  say that they <i>don't.</i> We argue, <i>that people ought to possess the
  means of ascertaining who among shopkeepers are honest, and who are
  not;</i> then the just would meet with justice, and the unjust would
  suffer for their own sins.

  Bread contains eighty nutritious parts in 100; meal, thirty-four in

  100; peas, ninety-three in 100; lentils, ninety-four in 100; cabbages

  only eight pounds of solid matter in 100 pounds; carrots and spinach
  produce fourteen in the same quantity; whilst 100 pounds of potatoes
  contain twenty-five pounds of dry substance.  From a general estimate
  it results, that one pound of good bread is equal to two pounds and a
  half or three pounds of potatoes; that seventy-five pounds of bread
  and thirty of meat may be substituted for 300 pounds of potatoes.  The
  other substances bear the followed proportions: four parts of cabbage
  to one of potatoes; three parts of turnips to one of potatoes; two

<br>
  This fashionable and delightful game, suitable for both ladies and
  gentlemen, is generally played on a lawn or grass-plat by two, three,
  or four players, with balls and racquet bats. The object of the game
  is to strike a ball over a net and keep it in play backwards and
  forwards within certain limits. The court or ground may be of any size
  consistent with the lawn, the base lines being marked out by chalk, or
  tapes slightly pinned to the turf, which should be frequently mown and
  rolled. The mode of play may be seen from the following leading rules,
  which are now generally accepted by all players.

<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
The <i>Court</i>, for a single-handed game, should be 78 ft. long and
    27 ft. wide, and for a double-handed game the same length, but 36
    ft. wide, divided across the centre by a <i>net</i> attached to two
    upright posts. The net should be 3 ft. 6 in. high at the posts, and
    3 ft. at the centre. At each end of the court, parallel with the
    net, are the <i>base lines</i>, whose extremities are connected by the
    <i>side lines</i>. The <i>half-court line</i> is halfway between the side
    lines and parallel with them. The <i>service lines</i> are 21 ft. from
    the net and parallel with it.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    The <i>balls</i> should be 2-1/2 in. in diameter and 2 oz. in weight.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    The players stand on opposite sides of the net. The player who
    first delivers the ball is called the <i>server</i>, the other the
    <i>striker-out</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    At the end of each game the striker-out becomes server, and the
    server striker-out.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

   The server stands with one foot beyond the base line, and
    delivers the service from the right and left courts alternately.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    The balls served must, without touching the net, drop within the
    court nearest to the net, diagonally opposite to that from which the
    striker serves it.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

   If the service be delivered from the wrong court it is a
    <i>fault</i>. It is also a fault if the server does not stand in the
    manner as stated above, or if the ball served drop in the net or
    beyond the service line, or if it drop out of court, or go in the
    wrong court.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    A fault must not be taken, that is, played back to the server.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    The striker-out may not <i>volley</i> the service. Volleying is
    striking the ball back before it has touched the ground.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    The ball, having been returned, must be kept in play either by
    volleying it, or striking it back after the first bounce. A ball
    bouncing twice is out of play.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    If, in serving, the ball touch the net and go over into the
    proper court, it counts to neither server nor striker-out.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    The server scores if the striker-out volley the service, or
    fail to return the service in such a way that the ball would fall
    within the opponents' court.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    Two consecutive faults count a stroke against the server.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    If the ball when in play touch either player it scores a stroke
    for his opponent.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    The first stroke won by either player scores 15 to that player;
    the second, won by the same player, raises his score to 30, his
    third stroke to 40, and his fourth counts <i>game</i>. If, however, the
    players have both scored 40, it is called <i>deuce</i>, and the next
    stroke won by either is called <i>advantage</i> to the winner of it, and
    if he also win the following stroke he scorea <i>game</i>. Should he lose
    it the score returns to <i>deuce</i>. The player winning two consecutive
    strokes directly following a <i>deuce</i> scores game.</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>

    Whichever player first scores six games is considered to win
    the <i>set</i>.</li></ol>
